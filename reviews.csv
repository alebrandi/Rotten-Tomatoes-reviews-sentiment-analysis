3,Chris,"Dec 24, 2019",The movie didn’t have a Star Wars vibe. The movie was very visually pleasing and had good intentions to end the saga but It just didn’t get it done. Disney does not listen to the fans and will face the usual backlash.,2.5

5,BrokeNBoredom,"Dec 24, 2019",I will say I wasn't too excited for the latest entry in Star Wars after The Last Jedi left a bad taste in my mouth. I think the trilogy would have been serviced better if all three films were directed by JJ Abrams. with that said I really enjoy this movie which left me with wanting to see more or what could of have been before this movie. I think the story is entertaining but definitely feels like a follow up to Force Awakens.,4.0

71,Lilly,"Dec 24, 2019","love the story, hate the pacing. 
this should've at least been an hour longer. so many big reveals were crammed into this average runtime and even normal moments were edited and paced so quickly I think I missed half the film. definitely worth a watch, but I hope and pray they release an extended edition with actually good pacing.",2.5
72,Gil,"Dec 24, 2019","The movie started off really choppy and disconcerting.  It took a bit for the story to get going and by the time it did, you are left scratching your head at how it started. I will say that there quite a few surprises along the way that go a long way towards answering long awaited questions,  but still, the overall feeling of the movie was choppy and long...",2.0

75,Dan,"Dec 24, 2019","Amazing. all the bad reviews are from soulless, joyless, hopeless critics who just forever hurt that they don't have the gall to make movies so they disapprove of others work.  JJ Abrams did a fantastic job of taking the baton from Rian Johnson and running with it. this moviendoesnt change retcon The Last Jedi but gives it more depth and the movies are better together than separate.",5.0

Some humor was forced.
Poe's speech towards the end, was unnecessary & felt cheesy.",5.0
80,DeNomolos,"Dec 24, 2019","This film corrected the errors made in the last one. I think J.J. Abrams did a great job considering what he was left with at the end of Ep 8. 

Don't believe the haters - I'm a SW fan (but NOT a fanboy) and have been to every one of the episodes in the theaters (yes, even the 1977 one) and I am of the opinion that this movie is not perfect but well worth the watch. 

Go see it! You'll be glad you did.",5.0

83,Sam,"Dec 24, 2019","If you enjoy watching movies for the pure entertainment value, then you'll probably like this movie. The vfx are good and there's enough twist and turns to keep your focus. The many callbacks to past movies are great from point of view. However, if you're a diehard fan, I could see how this movie would be too jumpy and would generally be unsatisfying for you.",4.0
84,DELETED USER,"Dec 24, 2019","The best of the new trilogy. I still have to view these as fanfiction and I have some big problems with this movie, but I overall really enjoyed it and it really helped get rid of the bad taste left after the trash heap that was TLJ.",4.5

88,Mr. Do,"Dec 24, 2019","I love SW, I saw ""A New Hope"" in 1977.  I like the characters and actors but this last story was all over the place.  I am not sold on JJ Abrams.  It may have been better to stretch it out into two parts like Harry Potter.  Some new characters and themes came out but there was no time to explore them.  I really wanted to like this movie since it is the last one.  Sometimes that just does not work out.",2.0

113,Matthew,"Dec 24, 2019",it's not that it's a bad movie but JJ Abrams writing is just lazy. It's as if he googled fan theories and picked the ones he like. When he said people would be divided he was very right. You will either love or hate this movie,3.0

126,Brandon L,"Dec 24, 2019","It was a true Star Wars movie.  No need to ""Subvert Expectation"". Im so sick of people saying thats what so great about The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson subverted expectations.  WHY? There was no need. This is star wars, there was no need to stray from the formula of the last 7 movies before it.  Why would you decide to try something new with 2 movies left in the saga.  I guess really it comes down to Kathleen Kennedy allowing him to try something new.  If you want to subvert expectations or try a new formula, then you do that in a side story. Not at the end of the saga.  IMO.",4.0

129,Walter,"Dec 24, 2019",Great cap to the 9 part series. Always hard to end a story and please everyone. I would have sat through 20 more minutes to get more character development and explanation of certain aspects of the film that could have been flushed out. Mainly more palpatine backstory an explanation of how he was able to stay alive. Good overall though with plenty left for critics and story tellers to flush out and expand on.,4.5
130,Beverly,"Dec 24, 2019","It seemed like a dark story, but it does follow the previous story, so I get it.  I wasnt sure why exactly Kilo REN disappeared after he kissed Rey, but it is part of the mystery of the force.",5.0

135,Christian Layman,"Dec 24, 2019","8/10 It’s a great movie that wraps up the Skywalker Saga of StarWars. However, there are some aspects of the movie I didn’t like. Even though the movie was rushed, it did have great special effects, outstanding music score from John Williams, and make you feel accomplished finishing these 9 episodes from the Skywalker’s point of view. The Force will be with you always, This is The Way, and leave after the credits end. There’s nothing to see after the credits.",4.0
136,Robert S,"Dec 24, 2019",The movie was horribly paced. The story was meh and predictable. Rey was continued to be Mary Sue and Disney continued to show its incompetence with understanding true Star Wars story telling and lore. I pray they lose control of this franchise and someone else can do it justice.,2.0

peter","Dec 24, 2019",perfect end to the saga...,5.0
145,Tyler,"Dec 24, 2019","The conclusion to the Skywalker Saga was, in every way, very satisfying. Not only did it succeed in very finally closing out this story, it did so in a way that made it's predecessor make more sense, making it more enjoyable. It's obvious that J.J. Abrams and everyone else who had a part in creating this story paid attention to detail to make sure that not only was continuity not broken (though I've seen it said that it did), but that the Emperor being back did not necessarily make everything that Luke and Anakin fought for for naught, simply because of how they did it. The reverence with which they retired Leia after the passing of Carrie Fisher was amazing, and made sure that Leia had a lasting impact on every character in the trilogy. Overall, a wonderful movie that keeps true to the Star Wars traditions of hope and tradition. It truly felt like a very fitting end to such an iconic saga.",4.5

150,Will Mckinley Jr.,"Dec 24, 2019",Seriously the best Star Wars movie of the entire franchise. The Rise of Skywalker ties up the loose ends of The Last Jedi amazingly. Cinematography was stellar as well. Very well done overall.,5.0
151,Evan K,"Dec 24, 2019","I binged 1-8 over 6 days prior to seeing this movie. This movie did a really good job to provide closure to the story and also relate back to each prior movie.

Im disappointed in them and again the movie scenes didnt really make much sense at all. That being the final fight as well as the fact all those Star destroyers were destroyed.",1.5

212,Sherril B,"Dec 24, 2019","Long time Star Wars fan but hated this movie. Weak story line that progressed though ""coincidences"" vs natural unfolding of events. Writers used too much verbal telling of the plot through actors vs showing the plot or letting the plot play out in the movie. Several times entire story lines were simply told/summed up in several lines. Zero chemistry among the actors with fairly poor acting - exception Daisy Ridley who unfortunately had no one to play off. Honorable mention to Adam Driver but it is hard to take him seriously in the role they gave him. Rested on the same literary technique/joke structure at least 6-7 times which caused the comedic relief to seem forced and as if watching a movie a 6th grader wrote. When all of the above is combined, you walk away feeling the writers/directors/producers must assume we are all so stupid we could not possibly watch a movie and comprehend any plot more complicated than a Disney cartoon. Just another rushed Hollywood movie for the sake of making as much quick cash as possible.

241,Dusty,"Dec 24, 2019","Great ride, a solid end to the trilogy, a nice message about being who you choose to be regardless of where you come from and a nice, even fun goodbye to a series that some of us have ridden alongside our entire lives. BIG visuals, epic stakes and, sure, a few contrivances, but nothing that felt outside the universe. People complained when Force Awakens as too much like what came before and others derided Last Jedi for departing from that in some ways. You cant please everyone. Do yourself a favor and dont insist on being victimized by a freaking movie. Kick back and enjoy! Whatever Star Wars moments you love from childhood are still out there and you might get more here. You wont feel cheated or like something is wrong- but maybe something will be missing when its over. Its Star Wars! Its done! But it will always be with us like a blue-tinged memory and the movie does a great job of reminding us that our past can support us, but letting it make your decisions for you (like how you feel about this movie) is the path to the Dark Side.",5.0

But ultimately, if you are a die hard Star Wars fan  the Star Wars saga really ended when Darth Vader threw the Emperor over the balcony in Return Of the Jedi. All of these sequels had MAJOR issues and just felt like a cash cow for Disney. But getting to see light sabers and X Wings is always worthy of a look.",3.5

285,DELETED USER,"Dec 24, 2019","Pros: Visuals and sound are top notch. Kylo has a good moment, as well as Poe with a new character. C3P0 has two funny lines. Ian always plays Emperor perfectly.

Cons: Rey has no personality. At some point in this trilogy I wanted to see her talk nonchalantly with friends about dreams and simply what's on her mind. Otherwise, I'm not able to relate to the character and I just end up watching someone do things. I have no investment and I don't feel the stakes. Luke does this in the OT, expressing how he feels stuck and yearns to move on to something else. Also when he's talking to Obiwan and Yoda. This helps me put myself in their position and feel a connection. Without this, its just another soulless action flick. Yeah there's a bunch of cool looking stuff flying all over the screen, but why do I care?
Secondary cons are the many many plot conveniences, sometimes to comedic proportions. It takes me out of the movie. Maybe the film makers figured if they kept rushing from scene to scene, we wouldn't notice? If so, it seems to have paid off to some extent because many people don't mention them. 

I guess today's movies are about being flashy, and not properly developing a character. Welp, hope the Mandalorian doesn't go that route.",1.5

Regardless of that I did not expected some cameos like Harrison Ford’s or all the Jedi voices. I liked the redemption path and regression to Ben Solo that we had I just wish he hadn’t gone that way or that Rey’s lineage and dark side was explored more not just merely presented.",4.0

325,Adam,"Dec 24, 2019","The Rise of Skywalker is a fantastic movie. I am an active fan of Star Wars and  keep up with all of its conent, this movie is what a Star Wars conclusion should be. While this is a direct sequel to The Last Jedi, it builds on  it's good aspects and apologizes for many of it's wrong doings. I thought The Last Jedi was decent, but The Rise of Skywalker tops it's predecessor in every category. I believe that the critics are not loving this movie because it doesn't do well as a stand alone film, but any fan with a general knowledge of the previous 8 films should love the film. While I wish there were more references to the prequels, it does a great job following up the original and sequel trilogy. It is a great story and an even better conclusion to the Skywalker Saga.

My one gripe!

Outside of the random small stuff, I actually really enjoyed the movie.  The first half of the movie should've been it's own movie, or they need a directors cut with the whole first half of it.  They were clearly attempting to fit everything into the movie, and it was noticeable to the point of detraction.  Last half of the movie was really great, and I think they should've waited until then for the big reveal.  The big mystery was erroneously thrown into the beginning of the movie. Literally, they should've kept the villain a mystery until Kylo and Rey were at the mystery planet.",4.5

And while I would say Rise of Skywalker is a must-see, ultimately it isn't a perfect conclusion to the main Star Wars Saga. If I were to nit-pick some of the movie's shortcomings, it would be that many of the elements are predictable as the story unfolds, the lightsaber and dog fights are on the weak side, and one major character is left completely unresolved and virtually unmentioned (exactly who is a bit of a spoiler).

I herd people giving this film 1-2 stars, my review I’m giving it a half a star more than I did Dark Fate. 3-1/2 for me. Even for the diehard StarWars fans, it’s alright.

Some great scenes throughout the movie that highlighted the internal battle between light and darkness and gave us more emotion and character reality. Had a hard time processing certain answers to the big questions that we were wanting and it didn’t sit right with how certain doors to open hallways were closed and how it was done. I mean it felt shallow and rushed with creating these answers and finishing the skywalker saga the way that it was told and that is my big time dislike. This movie really had all the potential to come up huge and take this series on a strong and respectable tribute to the entire Star Wars name and legacy. But in the end it didn’t do that.

573,Carolyn J,"Dec 24, 2019","Sometimes ""less is more"".  This was one of those times.  Given that this was the end of the saga, the creators tried to cram everything into the finale and bring back all our favorite people: Lando, Han, Luke, Leia.  The only one missing was Yoda.
The first half was intense with fights and battles and disjointed with the leaps from story line to story line.
The development of the final story began in the second half.  Kylo Ren's redemption was predictable.  The kiss was not.  I was sorry that Rose had such a small part this time. Rey, Finn and Poe lived up to expectations.  The ending with Rey declaring herself a ""Skywalker"" was hokey but I guess it provided the necessary closure.  
Not my favorite sequel.  Sequels 4, 5, 7 and 8 were the best.
But after 42 years, the story has come to an end although I am sure Disney will be tempted to produce some inadequate spinoffs.",3.0

578,Will N.,"Dec 24, 2019","I have been a fan ever since seeing Star Wars in 78 with my younger brother, have seen every movie in the theater since, used to have every toy as a child, and when I say that SW seemed more like a religion to us that wouldnt be an exaggeration.  The twists and turns within The Empire Strikes Back shook our world in 80 (becoming our favorite movie) and a few years later in 83 we watched as our heroes fought for good to restore peace throughout the galaxy and restore balance to the Force in Return of the Jedi.  The writing and storytelling of that OT was magical (based on mythology) and a feeling Ive been hoping to rediscover ever since.  In short, TPM was a major letdown, AOTC was a little better, with ROTS being the best prequel offering,  TFA was enjoyable for the most part and offered hope with the introduction of new characters, but TLJ was an absolute train wreck of a story (for so many reasons) dismantling most character backgrounds that were set up in TFA and treating OT characters as disposable pawns in order to push a flawed/baseless story.  I LOVED Rogue One (faith was restored once again), and found Solo to give me some of the old SW feels at times.  I couldnt wait to see how TROS would close out the sequel trilogy and being the lifelong SW fan had my mind feverish with theories.

This movie is visually stunning, and as usual John Williams offers up a score that is the emotional lifeline that keeps you engaged throughout.  The actors (who are amazing) finally start to gel together in this final offering of the sequel trilogy, at times almost reminiscent of the chemistry of the original trilogy...and this is unfortunately where the good ends.

The writing of this movie is lazy, at times haphazard, with plots (and various sub plots) unfolding out of pure convenience out of nowhere just because.  The iconic opening crawl even seemed poorly written, and from the jump of the movie youre whisked away into multiple scavenger hunts with frantic cut scenes full of fan service over good storytelling.  Theres an iconic villain that reappears out of nowhere, with no explanation, but due to convenience youre expected to accept and move on.  The movie continues at a breakneck pace over multiple new planets, introducing new characters (offering little more than surface level background, iconic cameos with more convenient tie-ins) with even more plots magically unfolding.  At one point JJ even steals directly from The Goonies (wtf?)!!  The first and second acts of the film felt more like shots pieced together based on test screening scores rather than a cohesive story and at time borrowing directly from ROTJ.  The third and final act is where I found the writing to be the weakest and where the fan service kicked in fully.  Without offering up any spoilers, more plot holes are created and major character arcs of the prequels and the OT were completely dismantled by subpar writing (IMO) and choices made within TROS.  The ending concludes conveniently easily and almost as quickly as the movie started.  

All in all I left the theater feeling like a huge part of my childhood had been sucker punched in the mouth and my lunch money taken by Kathleen Kennedy and Disney.",2.5

Overall Rise of Skywalker was a very enjoyable movie that really did tie up some arcs across all of the trilogies.  I think they should have pushed the run time a bit longer maybe in order to better explain a few of the newer plot points, but then they're pushing Endgame/LOTR territory and I can see why they might want to avoid that.  I almost suspect Disney wanted to leave some things unexplained for potential later side-story movies similar to Rogue One and Solo.",4.0

599,DELETED USER,"Dec 24, 2019","*NO SPOILERS* Don't let bitter people and their inaccurate reviews of this movie deter you from watching. JJ Abrams take the iconic Star Wars saga and complete it more gracefully than anyone ever could have. Rey's mysterious story, background and purpose was finally revealed in what I believe was one of the most poetic and thrilling storylines yet. Finn's character development is probably the second best part of the movie. C3PO finally got to be a star in one of the movies and was just the taste of nostalgia the older viewers needed. Many people I discussed the movies with always hated Kylo Ren, I could see why (he's a huge crybaby) However, this movie sums up why he was the way he was in the two prior movies and what we all basically knew all along. As someone who grew up with the newer movies, I have always been a little shy to share my opinion of the movies especially episodes 7 & 8. But I can't keep how great of a movie this was to myself.

The movie for some suffers from having too much material packed for one film, however, being the last movie and needing to close many different plot points, its understandable and if you are willing to watch, you end up seeing 2 Star Wars movies for the price of one. As a person who grew up watching the original trilogy in the 80s on TV and on VHS, and later we had the prequel trilogy and now the Disney sequel trilogy, there is a lot to be appreciative about in this final movie from the cast, writers and JJ Abrams. They achieved a final movie that lives up to expectations of the Star Wars universe. Characters are not perfect in this movie, including Rey... its very entertaining and the cast did a wonderful job.

655,John,"Dec 24, 2019","First, I am a Star War fan since the beginning and have seen EVERY episode/movie. This was the WORSE one so far.  The plot was fragmented at times and the movie overall was overshadowed by predictable action scenes.  Examples: the main character fights numerous times however at NO TIME does her white clothing bear even a smudge of dirt even though her face is bloodied. Really? Also, how the characters are able to walk on bvb the outside of a battlecruiser while in space while wearing no spacesuit or breathing apparatus almost led me to walk out. But the popcorn was good and I wasn't going to waste it. 
First these reasons and more I was very disappointed in this movie and I deeply  regret that I will never get back those 2+ hours of my life. Oh well, at least it wasn't ""Cats""! Overall, dull, disappointing and lackluster.  Lucas Films, you flopped this one.",0.5

When he said he represented all the sith, the film panned to all the sith in attendance.  When she crossed her swords and said she represented all the Jedi, this was an opportunity to show good v evil, and to have all the spirits of the Jedi (Yoda, Luke, Darth, Obi-wan, et cetera) stand behind her, in unity.  But, the film had her alone, with no support.  So, the Jedi could come back from the dead and talk to her, but at the biggest moment in the life of the galaxy, they were absent?  Very bad and a big opportunity missed.",3.0

However, there were many choices made that are irritating to me as a Star Wars fan. Force powers are now way over the top, Force ghosts can interact with the environment, and force users require little no training but can accidentally use the most powerful (canon) force abilities. It was certainly better than the Last Jedi, however there is room for improvement. Here is hoping it does well enough for Disney to keep making movies but please follow marvel and have one person with executive control over the franchise like KF.",3.5

It has all the classic Star Wars galactic and light-saber battles that you'd expect, and they're fun to see--but it has more than that, and the critics have by and large missed the special moments. For example, when Rey throws away her light saber and the Luke-ghost unexpectedly catches it. The point or parable: you cannot throw away what Greta Thunberg calls her superpower. You have to keep it, guard it, make best use of it. What a fine and novel ""teaching"" in the Star Wars context. And there's much more of that kind.",4.5

914,Ted,"Dec 24, 2019","Spoilers ahead:


If the premise of your movie is that the big bad guy never died because his race has technology that brings him back for the dead, you are basically saying killing him doesnt matter because he can always come back. Therefore nothing the protagonist does matters. Add to that the fact that the diad idea was poorly laid out, the dialogue was clunky and generic, and literally everyone who died somehow wasnt dead 10 minutes later and you get a movie where it seems like you actually wanted everyone to emotionally divest. This movie was so disappointing.",0.5

916,Scott O.,"Dec 24, 2019","Rise of Skywalker is a great closure to the series. It was deeply emotional, gripping, and humorous all in one presentation. I know this is billed as the end, but my hope is there will be another generation to bridge the next trilogy series. 
The truth is that there will always be people to find faults because there literally could be thousands of potential storylines that could have been told, but the reality is this was the one for us. And this story was beautiful in its own right.",5.0

920,Jenny F,"Dec 24, 2019","It was great!  It reminded me of the original Star Wats in the style of making. It had beautiful and unique new background scenes, personal relations between the characters, comedy, a touch of romance, and a well developed story line. Yes, there was fighting but it was well distributed this time. It wasnt all fighting. Yes, it was a little corny sometimes and unbelievable at others, but most of Star Wars IS that. Its lovably corny and awesome all at the same time!  I would definitely recommend taking the whole family to go see it. Excellent movie!",5.0
921,Lei,"Dec 24, 2019","This movie should be called ""DAMAGE CONTROL"".  For some odd reason, nobody wants to admit the Last Jedi was HORRIBLE, MADE NO SENSE, RUINED BELOVED CHARACTERS and had endless PLOT HOLES.  This move spends about 75% of the time fixing Rian Johnson's mess.  Disney proves it isn't oblivious to the fact that giving the core demographic the bird and belittling them for not like Last Jedi was probably a terrible business decision.  Solo proved when the core fans revolt, the movie tanks.  Unfortunately the damage can't be reversed.  The movie tries, Kilo actually seems like a threat and Rey shows weakness, both pluses.  Poe and Finn get more screen time, good decision.  Palpatine's return is not explained, mistake.  The movie gets moving, and never slows down to the point where its a cram job and oddly, if slowed down and left with a cliffhanger where the evil prevailed probably would have saved the trilogy as it could lead into something people would be willing to come back too.  Disney, however has to give the fans the ""happy ending"" and it's so rushed that it is underwhelming.",1.5

926,Joshua K,"Dec 24, 2019","The very best (worst) of JJ Abrams' every flaw! The pacing was an all-out assault of the senses from beginning to end, distracting the average moviegoer from a slew of plot holes, contrivances, McGuffins, and unbelievable character decisions. Lots of set-up and bickering between characters that go nowhere. A fan-fiction premise that a teenager could have and probably has already written.  If you turn your brain off, you may leave feeling overwhelmed, but don't mistake that feeling for reasoning that this movie is somehow therefore great, or even just passable. I doubt many will even remember what happened in this movie, much less be able to explain it to others, or what any of this entire trilogy has meant... In short, ultimately, it all means nothing.",1.0

I will stick to the now-labeled Legends novels - better and more unique storylines with believable and deep characters of various backgrounds done by writers who honed their craft and kept those of us, from the first movie in 1976 until now, hooked on the Expanded Universe of Star Wars. You all tried but fell so short, as if you never left the starting line. Glad it is over.",1.5

1095,E,"Dec 24, 2019",Totally ignored most of the set up of the previous movie. Lots of great Star Wars action but none of it held together by a entirely coherent story. The three chapters don’t hold up cohesively - there clearly wasn’t a plan for the saga except perhaps the fate of the two main leads.  And the ancillary shows that could support them.

1102,R,"Dec 24, 2019","The ending is good, which is good because the beginning is terrible. At the start, the film is simply a mess. The characters zip from one planet to another finding this thing so they can talk to this other person so they can find some other thing that leads them somewhere else. It has very little to it other than a seemingly pointless fetch quest, but when we finally get to where we're going, the film is much better. 
Another positive is that the film focuses almost entirely on the core 4: Rey, Finn, Poe, and Kylo Ren. While this is good it also means that any other characters including those who were bigger in the 2 previous films now don't really matter or have much in the way of screen time. This also makes any new characters feel like nothing more than a chance to make new toys. 
The ending is still heavily flawed but at least it's better than the rest. 
In all, the conclusion I and many others have made is that the beginning is JJ Abrams making the film he would have made had he done The Last Jedi. Instead, we get too much crammed into too little time and an ending that would be more satisfying had the rest been better.",3.0

It's Last Jedi was a waste of a movie since it had no real reason for existing other than filling in a space for a 2nd movie. I really liked the story and liked how it moved the plot forward.

Ben Solo/Kylo Ren’s arch was the saving grace, but not worth the price of admission. If the trilogy was about his story, it would have been far more compelling.

Its fast-paced action and story pull you along for a wild and emotional ride. The chemistry between the sets of characters keeps you engaged and rooting for them to the end.

1235,DELETED USER,"Dec 24, 2019","SPOILER ALERT:

A solid improvement over The Last Jedi (TLJ), Rise of Skywalker (ROS) has some very strong and powerful moments.  Unfortunately, the entire movie felt rushed by the need to cram in essentially two movies' worth of story to make up for the lost middle chapter of this ill-conceived Disney trilogy.  

On the positive side, ROS felt like a Star Wars movie, something TLJ failed miserably at attempting.  Kylo Ren's redemption was truly moving, as was Harrison Ford's cameo as Han Solo.   Reveals of how Leia became a Jedi, her role in bringing Ben back from the Dark Side, and Luke's return as a force ghost were all done incredibly well and had fans cheering in their seats, including me. 

Unfortunately, these great scenes did not have enough time to sink in because of the frenetic pace of the story, likely a side effect of a middle chapter (TLJ) that needed immense course correction.  Of additional concern is JJ Abrahams' utter lack of imagination (a criticism of his first chapter in The Force Awakens).  Bringing back Palpatine as the villain again was lazy storytelling but was plausible enough to pass (though how his return was accomplished is completely glossed over).  Addtionally, how his followers built a fleet unlike anything ever seen at the height of the Empire was less credible (it appeared as if thousands of Star Destroyers just emerged magically out of the ocean?!).  Perhaps most unforgivable though was making Rey Palpatine's granddaughter.  Frankly, it was almost laughable.  At what point did Palpatine ever have children?  Did he really seem like the type of person who would??  If he did, it would have been before his face was mutilated in Revenge of the Sith, at which point settling down and having a family seemed a pretty remote priority for him as he consolidated his new Galactic Empire.  And at no point in Episodes I-III is it even quietly suggested that he had children before becoming the Emperor.  It's another horrible Disney misinterpretation of an original OT character.  It just makes no sense.   TLJ determined that Rey was a nobody.  While TLJ was a failure for other reasons, this particular decision by director Rian Johnson made sense.  Not all Jedi were Skywalkers or from famous families (as shown by the Prequels).   Rey being a nobody who is strong in the force (not unlike a certain Anakin Skywalker) would have made her decision to choose ""Skywalker"" as her adopted name all the more powerful at the end of ROS.  The ""need"" to make her have an infamous grandparent by blood was another unimaginative repetition of what came before in the original trilogy.  

All in all, ROS is a better movie than TLJ by leaps and bounds, but is still a poor showing from Disney and its creative team.   Cinematic stories are best told when the writer(s) know the beginning, the middle, and the end in advance and then fill in the details as they go.  It is abundantly clear Disney and its directors had no such common vision when they began this new trilogy.   Rather, Disney hired two directors - JJ Abrams and Rian Johnson - who had competing visions for the direction of this final chapter of the Skywalker saga.  It shows.   In the end, one must ask if the Star Wars universe and the ""Skywalker storyline"" was enhanced, or more likely degraded, now that the final installment of this new trilogy has been revealed.",3.0

There are a lot of pretty action set pieces, but that's pretty much all this film is, action set pieces. There's no real story here. The first fifteen minutes of the film is spent rushing around and info dumping just to try and setup where they wanted this story to actually start. There were a lot of choices in this film that made no sense whatsoever, but simply forced into the film to try and create an ending. I could still easily watch this movie again when re-watching the saga, but it's not my favorite. It's a good popcorn action movie, but again, for a film that was suppose to function as an epic conclusion to all of this, it was just empty and hollow.",3.0

1389,Ace E,"Dec 24, 2019","Guys I really wanted to like this movie, I really did. I tried. I went in with my expectations low and my hopes high and left with a feeling of just meh. I just could not find much to like about it. 

There’s a lot to break down here so let me first touch on the things I did like. The score was great (par for the course, I mean it’s John Williams) and the humor in this movie was actually really well done. It didn’t feel forced as it did in the last movie. I genuinely did laugh out loud at a couple of scenes. The actions sequences were great. The lightsaber duels here were probably some of the best in this trilogy. There were also some emotional parts that really hit home which added some much needed emotional depth to characters that had none previously. So yeah, that about sums up the things I liked. Now everything else? Whew boy…what the heck were they thinking?!

I’ll tell you what JJ was thinking, he was thinking, “I gotta fix this! I need to appease the raging fans!” It had to be what was going through his mind as evident by the amount retconning or “fixes” in this film. Ultimately that hurt my ability to enjoy this movie. The copious amounts of fan service and forced nostalgia was suffocating. They should’ve named the movie, Star Wars: The Rise of Damage Control. The Last Jedi set up themes of the force being mystical and boundless and TRoS turns that on its head and makes it about who’s related to whom. (Who is your daddy and what does he do? *in my Arnold voice*) 

My biggest problem with this movie was the same problem I had with The Force Awakens. It was the obvious rehashing of A New Hope and that problem returns here as the final act was essentially a rehashing of Empire Strikes back AND Return of the Jedi’s final act. I mean there are scenes that were completely lifted from RotJ! I just had to shake my head in disbelief at how obvious it was. 

There were also a couple “big reveals” that were very predictable. One in particular was set up in the first 10 mins of the movie and when I saw the set up I said to myself, “yup they’re setting up for such-n-such to happen.”  And of course it happened. Lol There was one reveal that I literally laughed out loud in the theater because of how bad it was. 

Guys look, if you were one of those fans who hated TLJ and felt like you deserved a different movie then this was made for you. You’re probably gonna love it. If you’re like me and actually liked TLJ, flaws and all, then this movie might upset you. The problem with TRoS is that it tries to be a sequel to TFA and be the sequel to itself at the same time. Basically disregarding TLJ altogether. It’s because of that this movie becomes a bloated and choppy mess. 

All in all I’d have to say I didn’t care for The Rise of Skywalker. It’s my least favorite of the Disney trilogy.",2.5

The scene when Kylo Ren brings back Rey reminded me of the scene from Cocoon 2. When the Emperor sucked the life out of Rey and Kylo, yeah, that was from the Mummy. The end scene when everyone showed up, that was End Game. Couple those things with cheesy dialogue, an awful performance from Mark Hammel, and a pointless cameo from Harrison Ford, and you got another horrible Star Wars movie. Luckily, it wasn’t as bad as The Last Jedi, which will probably go down as the worse Star Wars Movie next to the prequels....maybe even worse.",0.5

It was so different from anything created up until then.

I was shocked when it was told Darth was Luke's father in empire.. 

I remember seeing a pre production still in a magazine of the new death star being built, and was so excited to see the final movie in the trilogy in return. 

Rise of Skywalker was made for people like me, and I loved it.  As Abrams said, no matter what his choices, he'd have praise from some, and vilification from others.

The best parts of me watching that first movie at 8 years old came back in this film.  The same type of excitement as when you saw the millennium falcon fly again in this trilogy.

It was the perfect movie to wrap up the story....  And I think those that were pre teen watching star wars in the theater in 1977 would agree.",5.0

Sometimes, faster cuts and lots of camera movement feel like a trick to make you see less of what's actually happening, and jumping straight into new concepts of how things work with no dialogue about the mechanics is confusing, rather than a powerful visual illustration. While this movie at least completed the story arc of the new trilogy, it left me feeling like I've just spent a lot of time investing in characters and a plot struggling to get me to the same happy ending as Episode 6 (Return of the Jedi). The result: fast pacing, less friendship between the characters, and more dependence on throwbacks to the old movies to keep the thing alive. The best piece of new storytelling was the Kylo Ren/Ben Solo story. That brings the movie up from 2 starts to 3.",3.0

All I can say is the movie is a bit too long, keep it the 2 hours mark or shorter.  If it's good, then people long for more, if it's bad then at least you don't dread it on for too long.  Because of all the praise on Adam Driver, I think he is borderline over rated now.  The cast overall is good.  I keep hearing this one is trying to right the wrong the Last Jedi did.  I don't know what would that be.  One thing missing is the feeling between Finn and Rose or rather Rose towards Finn, Rose basically is missing in action in this final one.  Maybe that's the wrong in the Last Jedi?  I have no idea.  Then of course there is the mystery and annoyance deliberately left behind by Abrams, What does Finn want to tell Rey?  Abrams is annoying in that way.",3.0

After all, he had to fix Rian Johnson’s debacle of episode VII. However Abrams did tie up a lot of loose ends, and provided some service to fans expectations. If only JJ had two episodes to tell the story he wanted to tell, he would have had more time to further develop plot points, characters, and relationships that made the originals so special. The blame lands squarely on Kathleen Kennedy.",3.0

1661,Joe,"Dec 25, 2019","See it. Watch it in context as best you can. I think Abrams made the best of a bad situation and completed a circle as well as he could. Yes, it all could have been better. Episode 7 didn't have to remake episode 4. Rian Johnson didn't have to ""subvert expectations"" and turn Luke into a old coward then kill him (spoiler warning!). And TROS didn't have to be lazy in some of its major threads. But it was the best of the sequel trilogy as far as entertainment value. The visuals were beautifully well done and the fight scenes were emotional and exciting without looking like they were being performed at 3x speed by master martial artists. It had what I thought was an enjoyable amount of humor without going too far or relying on it too much. I don't think their use of Leia worked but I understand that it was a very difficulty situation so I do think they honored her well. Anyone saying it's the worst Star Wars film ever is being melodramatic and silly. The Last Jedi still has an iron grip on that title. This film is a vast improvement over TLJ, even with its flaws. I may not see it again in a theater but I will see it again and I'll enjoy it.",3.5

1737,Willie D,"Dec 25, 2019","It was a very good movie. Sometimes it felt that the story was a bit rushed, as if they were trying to tie up every loose end within the time frame of one movie instead of two. Probably related to the pacing, the movie lacked a bit of the heart that was evident in episodes 4 through 6.  I also would have liked more development of Kylo Rens character. He was, by far, the most interesting villain in the series. However, all in all, I really enjoyed the movie and will see it again.",4.0

Also the writers’ attempts to connect the story to the past appeared forced and far too predictable. Speaking of forced, the final resolution of the saga made less sense than the final episode of Game of Thrones. What a pity.

But from what everyone was complaining about I thought I was going to hate it.

For a movie that's over two hours it felt like the story was rushed along and too many obvious attempts at comic relief ( more than I can recall in other Star Wars films).  The ending was abit cliche for my tastes and felt abit anticlimactic.

This was such a full and intense story that it almost could have been a trilogy by itself... and the directing to do it in 2.5 hours...and honor Carrie Fisher... was impressive.    Final note:  I saw the first Star Wars (A New Hope - Ep 4) as a child in 1977... and this was an excellent ending to conclude this story.   Thank you JJ (and always George)!",5.0

1790,John WT Foxtrot,"Dec 25, 2019","There were a lot of things that didnt seem Star Wars universe likely to occur but far superior to Episodes 1, 2 and 3. Four and a half stars if they went more raiders of the lost arc on finding the thingy and another half star if they didnt force some scenes, they were obviously afterthoughts. Why was that ship in the desert not scavenged for parts like all other vessels or craft found laying around? We all know how Star Wars characters like to recycle and trade parts for credits, food or safe passage. They could have simply had that ship sunk into the ground and had Rey Jedi Force unbury it when they found it underground. Think Luke and the xWing, Yoda xWing swamp, Palpatine raising the fleet, etc. then close it out with the laying to rest of the twins (Luke and Leias) light sabers using force burying. Hello! Could have tied that in a bow!",3.5

The rest of the film does some justice, but overall fails to manifest some of its greatest potential story arcs (looking at you, Knights of Ren). The most important moments are clearly the result of JJ Abrams salvaging the mess that Rian Johnson left him with, which could likely have been avoided had Disney not given full creative freedom to a secondary director.",1.5

1873,Greg,"Dec 25, 2019","An appropriate and imaginative ending to the saga spanning literally a lifetime. I saw Star Wars (that's all it was called then) in the theater when I was 9 years old. It opened my mind to wonder an imagination that I had never experienced, and I have been a fan of the series ever since. Some of the films are good, some are not as good, some are epic, but the saga is a great story of  family, friendship and believing in something greater than yourself on many levels. I've enjoyed every one of these films from that perspective. 

I loved the original trilogy, and was thrilled to relive it with Lucas' updated effects and added scenes. I loved the backstory of the prequels, and the way it gave me insight as an adult into the characters I had come to know as a child. The last trilogy brings the story full circle, and I am thrilled with how it turned out. 

This is entertainment at its finest, the epitome of the ""suspension of disbelief"" that I wholeheartedly feel is the core of any cinematic experience. Those who choose to dial into the rabid criticism of the series, in my opinion, just don't get it. Star Wars has been a delightful journey, one that I have been excited to relive with my children and get to share the final chapters with over four decades after my first jaw-dropping experience at the sight of Princess Leia's blockade runner being chased by Darth Vader's Star Destroyer. The final chapter brings everything full circle, and gives a lot of satisfying callbacks to the moments that made it the incredible story the Star Wars saga is. Well done.",4.5

Will you never watch another? No you have watched all of em.  So relax.  The last of the series is a big love letter to fans and brings the story full circle.  Our new Star Wars regulars are at it again but this story also brings redemption and a lot of thrills along the way.   I highly recommend the rise of Skywalker. Thanks to JJ Abrams and the amazing cast of this fun and poignant final chapter.,5.0

Will anyone watch these 10, 20, 30 years from now?  Nope!  Not classic, totally forgettable.  Rather, this was tremendous waste of the last opportunity to really make a suitable sequel to The Return of the Jedi.  Imagine what could have been made if in the right hands and minds.  Just imagine.  Well, they blew this chance and they won't get it again.  Carrie is dead.  Hamill and Ford aren't giving this another go.  Oh well.",2.0

While not great, it had all the basic elements it required to sum up the story in a timely and good fashion. There were several parts through the movie where the back and forth was SO extensive and unnecessary that I lost interest at some points. However, given this, I still believe this movie is a good way to end a franchise that has had 40+ years in the making.",4.0

I know that these characters from the original trilogies mean a lot to some people, but if you dont like what Disney  does with the characters then just ignore the movies. I look at this trilogy as its own thing instead of an ending to the 9 films weve gotten. I enjoyed the film immensely because it was just exciting and nostalgic throughout. Its not the greatest film ever made but Id definitely recommend. Just go into this movie with an open mind, and try not to let all the people who hate these movies affect your opinion on them.",4.5

There are some bumps along the way the pacing of the first half is choppy, and the film uncomfortably redefines a lot of Star Wars logic.

This is the kind of generic sci-fi film that requires zero thought while watching it other than to enjoy the well done special effects. This is a movie about nothing with characters who we know nothing about, even after 3 films. Rey is a Mary Sue character portrayed by a mediocre actor. Finn should’ve been the protagonist. The rest of the characters are interesting or unimportant. Kylo Ren is a joke of a villain/antagonist. Disney has crippled the Star Wars brand.",1.0

I invite you to not listen to critics and dont expect it all to rise to your cinematic standards...it is a Science-Fiction fantasy/fairy-tale. It will sell toys and merchandise just like George Lucas intended, and Disney has amped up with marketing and ummm, theme parks. Im the age of spoilers and rotten tomatoes, just go and enjoy 2 1/2 hours of unabashedly ridiculousness with hints of nostalgia to make you feel like a kid again. Also please understand that each of the trilogies (original/prequels/Disney era) are made for absolutely different generations (gen-X, millennials, and the now the instant gratification social media selfie generations). Each was made to meet the standards and entertainment needs of that target audience. Thank the gods for John Williams to meld all 9 movies together with his transcendent score that definitely still can evoke those emotional notes! I have kids ages 6 and almost 8, and darn tootin they were raised on Star Wars. This movie was PG-13 and I offered the best parental guidance possible for them to see this opening weekend. This is THEIR Star Wars, and I friggin love that I was able to have my boys on my side making those memories!!! May the Force Be With You, ALWAYS!",4.0

The Force Awakens was a good movie and an okay Star Wars film. The Last Jedi was a good movie and not a great Star Wars film. I think that Rose of Skywalker is the first to nail both. Great movie, great Star Wars story. It is nostalgic without trying to hit you over the head with it, and action packed. It hits all the notes for me and wraps up a lot of loose ends. Is it perfect? Who cares. Its a good movie. Lets be honest, if you grew up with the original trilogy like I did, youll never be satisfied. If you grew up with the prequels, youll never be satisfied.

 As a young man when episode 4 came out and a mature, but still immature 53 year old, Thanks for the effort.  You did good - respect",5.0

2180,Devin Gaumont,"Dec 25, 2019","Overall a great movie!  If youre a fan of the series, youll love this. Theres a great Episode 8 retcon and plenty of action. As always, a couple of criticisms. Lightsaber duels (while awesome and plentiful) seemed to play more like a couple people with no real saber training. It seemed like they were familiar with them, but there was no real... form there. Then theres  Palpatine. It came across like Mr Mcdairmid had forgotten how to play the character. Maybe that was the goal, but I felt the character had lost some of his gusto... part of what made the Emperor so great was his laughing cackle- which again seemed different. The finale was also lackluster. I found myself wanting to say to Palpatine, you went through this once before and it didnt work!  WHY are you trying this again??  It would have been great had there been one last lightsaber duel with Palpatine. The force lightning thins is just old at this point. Yeah, we know thats your bread and butter, Shiv.  Time for puppy to learn a new trick for a ScoobySnack.  But again, overall the film was great. Epic scenes. Epic battles.  Epic movie. Just a few small knit picks.",4.5

I also liked the original characters throughout the movie. My dislikes, were some of the scenes that dragged on and didnt have to, for example,  when they encountered the serpent. That dragged on way too long. And in some areas of the movie, I felt like it was rushed and wasnt really explained.  So I was a Star Wars fan, I enjoyed it!  And if I really wanted to be a hard-core Star Wars fan and get into it, theres a lot that couldve been done to make it  even better but every movies going to have its pluses and negatives. So with that said, these movies were a lot better then George Lucas add-ons,  Star Wars episode one through three",4.0

The main problem being that J.J. Abrams was trying to correct the errors of the previous entry (not that thats a bad thing) and was technically trying to cram two movies into one. At best, its a mildly entertaining movie for those not familiar with Star Wars and seeing it as a typical sci-fi-ish action movie, at worst, if youre a true fan of Star Wars then youll be left frustrated and unsatisfied.",0.5

There are a few items but they are more just kind of nit picking, for instance, there seemed to be a bit of unnecessary characters added and some existing ones not used in a better way (Rose) Really there is nothing bad about the movie as I believe it answers most questions though it does also raise some new ones and leaves some questions unanswered. I think also a few fans might now start to wonder when a stand alone Emperor movie will be in the works hint hint (if you've seen it you should know why one could actually be an option we could use now).",4.0

The humor that you expect from Star Wars was present and pretty well done. They managed to answer a lot of questions and bring the story full circle back to the original trilogy and the prequels. They managed to course-correct some of the unfortunate decisions of The Last Jedi. One thing I liked a lot is that the main characters were together for most of the movie and they all had meaningful and important roles in the story.

2272,Edward B  T,"Dec 25, 2019","My problem is that I have to see this movie. I am a life long Star Wars fan that saw the Original Trilogy a million times. The sequel trilogy has made plenty of nods to it legacy, though I don't know if it spoke to its own generation the way the Original Trilogy spoke to my generation.
The irritating part of this is that you will not like this movie the first time you see it.  I own all the Star Wars movies and I can say that watching the sequel trilogy on a Sunday afternoon with a case of craft beer is the only way to appreciate the glory of this this trilogy experience. Good bad whatever... Star Wars has always been about a statement of the generation to which it was released to.  Did it do its job... yes.  Are we a sole less society, yes. Still Star Wars is about a real concept, and that is love of the family.
While family ideals have become secondary to the new generation, Star Wars whispers at tradition while attempting to be contemporary. 
Bottom line is: Star Wars has always spoken to family values. The newest trilogy begs for respect from another generation, when it should screaming it own identity from the mountain top. It sorta accomplished its goal.

2331,DELETED USER,"Dec 25, 2019","This movie moves at break-neck speeds to establish new villains, undo mistakes from previous movies, and to resolve all new plot points before the credits roll. The pacing is fast that you cannot even comprehend the internal inconsistencies and disregard for the franchise's history lest you blink and miss critical plot points. Any scene long enough to actually rouse any feelings from the audience are undone only minutes later. Once the movie is over and realize this the official end for Disney's new Star Wars trilogy it's painfully clear that there was never a plan for this trilogy and it was never given the respect it deserved by the executives at Disney.",1.5

What you find out about Rey makes perfect sense, but could have been done in 7 or 8.  The ending was long winded, as were 7 and 8 IMO.

I went into this with little to no prior knowledge (a self-inflicted media blackout) to avoid any bias. I wanted to see it for what it should be...the end of a saga...rather than dissecting all of the details that JJ Abrams May have missed or messed up.

For that reason I give it 4/5 stars (or 8/10)...its a lot to process...maybe too much packed into a little over two hours...but I barely blinked the whole time (except maybe to blink back some tears near the end). Quite a film!",4.0

2391,Michael P,"Dec 25, 2019","As the eternal optimist and Star Wars loyalist, I had hopes for the final chapter to be better than Last Jedi and it was.  That, however, was about all I found positive about it.  The plot was not only full of holes and clumsy patches, but it all felt repetitive like I'd been there before.  I never found Rey all that likable and never felt, even after 3 movies, emotionally attached to her character like I did for Luke, Leia, Han, Cheewy, or even the droids. I also found it bizarre that Jedi can now heal people to the point of resurrecting them.  This kind of negates any feeling of dread that you feel for any character because they can always be healed.  This is only one of the curious holes in the script that undercuts the whole story and really continues the unfortunate disappointment of the latest trilogy.",2.5

When I watched the Avengers: Infinity War, I had never seen any of the characters individual movies let alone the other Avengers movies that came before this one. But I walked out of the theater wanting to watch all of the other movies.  Which I can say I thoroughly enjoyed. I knew I wanted to get caught up before End Game came out. 

The Rise of Skywalker did nothing for me. This movie is for fans. Ones that know the ins and outs of the franchises storyline. I dont know whether this was the intention or if Disney is just milking this franchise dry. I had no desire to watch the others before it. The scenes that were supposed to be epic were just lost on me.",1.0

(With the exception of Ep 1,2,3, of course. Those were just plain bad) Rise of Skywalker, based on the above, is an action-packed, epic experience for the senses, with a 42 year-old familiarity. A fitting conclusion for the Skywalker saga. 
Critics hate it. Fans love it. The box office is definitely loving it. Lighten up all you Francis-es and just enjoy it for what it is. Youll have a great time - maybe.",4.5

This was not a love letter to Star Wars fan and a movie to win over a new generation of Star Wars fans but a Disney Star Wars cash grab. I’m just disappointed because I like the trio of Rey, Poe, and Finn but none of them feel like the characters were developed very well.

I think he did a good job of trying to fill in the plot holes.  He may have played a bit too much homage to the original trilogy, but I can live with it.  Disney would be smart to give Abrams the ability to do the next trilogy.  If he can do three movies of the quality of Rogue One (arguably one of the best of all of the Star Wars films), Disney will redeem themselves.",3.5

There was absolutely no reason to end this series and Disney has no where else to go with their movies. If you take away the Jedi, Sith, Force Powers, or Lightsabers, then what you have is Star Trek.

2622,Carlos,"Dec 25, 2019","Movie was a little bit like Empire, but it had its differences. The return of Palpatine was amazing and he played the role he needed to play. The storyline closed off as it should be in my opinion and it finally gives us closure but also leaves room for more. The 2 previous movies were kind of a let down but this lived up to the name and I'm glad I call myself a Star Wars fan.",5.0
2623,Devlin S,"Dec 25, 2019","Really nice closure to the saga. Seen it twice so far and enjoyed it both times equally. Only thing that gets to me are the science aspects like how can people stand on top of a ship without flying off? Would say anti-gravity boots but 2 scenes ago they were running on top of the ship while fighting.  Also, does nobody need oxygen in this universe?  Just 2 of the small things that add up. Otherwise, movie was well done and nice to see it pay homage to the older movies.",4.0

2647,sarah s,"Dec 25, 2019","Almost every scene was meaningful, stylistically gorgeous, and appropriately timed. More importantly fans can rest easy knowing the final film pushes the characters to their limits and completely fleshes them out. Poe, Rey, and Finn are allowed to be together throughout almost the entirety of the film, and this is reminiscent of Han, Leia, and Luke. Their fun banter, their concern for each other, and their arguments bring fans closer to them and nostalgia seeps in which has always been this trilogy’s driving force. Delving deeper, Rey’s arc comes to a satisfying conclusion, and so puts to rest our previous doubts surrounding her storyline. On the other hand, Kylo Ren is introduced in the Force Awakens as a poor excuse for a villain. Now I understand - he was, is, and will forever be Ben Solo. This film is not flawless, the main con is perhaps that there are storylines gaps but honestly they are overlooked because we get the closure we hoped for.",5.0

2652,Divo,"Dec 25, 2019","2 1/2 hours went by faster than I thought.  Very well paced movie.  Action packed, for me there no lulls in the movie.  It keep me engaged and had many moments of shock and awe! So many good moments in this movie, like Lando coming to save the day, not once but twice!!  And good too see Han, Luke and the princess again.  A little disappointed that Rey lived and Ben died.  Thought he could've joined the resistance and trained as a Jedi.  But overall it's in the top 5 in the Star Wars saga",4.0

Things I liked about the movie were seeing Lando again, Kylo's redemption arc, the C-3P0 memory wipe segment, the music, and some of the visuals and effects. Things that just did not work are the many attempts at fan service. They come off as over the top and not authentic, Also the story had too much crammed into it and was harder to follow. And I still just don't care about these new characters very much. With that being said it was loads better than The Last Jedi. This film basically retcons most of The Last Jedi.",2.5

On second viewing it felt less rushed and the pacing surprised me in that it moved and was also moving. This is Star Wars space opera and space western. Laser guns and Horses! More please!",5.0

2783,#Maytheforcebewithyou,"Dec 25, 2019","it was a good movie, answered some questions and raised others not answered yet..felt it was closure on some aspects but there is more to be seen.  For some the last scene makes it seem it is not the end just a begining.  Finn still never told Rey what he wanted to tell her, He is force sensative, maybe another Jedi?  Ret and the yellow sabre?  For those that do not know it is reminiscant to a Jedi Sentinal of the ild Jedi temples, makes sense for her character development.  Original triology will never be touched and Empire Strikes Back will always be the number 1 of the 9 Skywalker movies.",4.0

The movie was jam packed with bigger explosions then ever, and yes more planet destroying weaponry. Too bad this new trilogy just ended up being a cash grab instead of providing or adding to real SW story telling mythology. The disgraced comics and books did a much better job then this set of movies. Why didn’t they just draw from those?...Disappointed overall in this Disney merchandise selling trilogy.",3.0

2923,Bryan S,"Dec 25, 2019","The first half of the movie is stuffed to the brim with so manny quick-cuts and moves so frentically that you don't have time to notice its shortcomings: namely the overstuffed script that relies on too many plot contrivances and convenient McGuffins. 

The second half slows down a bit so that the scenes can breathe and allow for the development of the emotional stakes of the main conflict.  However, many emotional beats are immediately undone in the subsequent scene so they ring hollow.  

It's a shame because there are some good parts that would have benefitted by fleshing out the characters and exploring the motivations but alas, the development consisted primarily of piling nostalgia-bait upon itself.  It seemed to be all in service of barreling towards the unsatisfactory and wholly unoriginal climax.

The one positive thing I can say is that Adam Driver as Kylo Ren was fantastic.  I wasn't a fan of the choices the script made regarding his character but his acting was stellar.

Wait for TRoS to come out on Disney+.",1.5

3013,Berenice G,"Dec 25, 2019","Aside from the problems of it trying re-write the previous film instead of building off of it, the film was just deeply underwhelming. From a story-telling perspective, it was just unoriginal and the plot was a bit muddled. It just felt like there were no real stakes, or at least the film did a poor job of selling you on the stakes that existed. There was just no real  tension. There were some good things though. The opening sequence of Kylo Ren was pretty great and the time spent with the three main friends was really enjoyable. Unfortunately, all the good stuff is just bogged down by a bad plot.",2.0

The first half was fairly boring, but the second half was exciting. There was a lot left unexplained, which was frustrating whenever they introduced some plot element or device. However, character arcs are concluded with a nice little bow on top. Overall, this movie is worth the watch. I think this trilogy’s experience leaves behind enough set up for another, and invites as much.",3.5
3074,David W,"Dec 25, 2019","I am really kind of split on this movie.  The Last Jedi really cut off the story and gave no clear plot for the final film.  So the start is very fast and kind of messy trying to establish a story to tell and end.  The last 1/3 was the best, so it improves as it goes.  Rey and Kylo were the best handled characters and form the heart of the film.  Since they are the two leads, it makes sense.  The rest get a little time, but amount to just tag alongs for the most part.  The new characters are very thin with very little establishment, but they are OK.  I liked The Force Awakens and I would say that if you like that, you will probably be happy with this.  It has the same general tone and feels like a follow on from it.  That is good with me because I really hated The Last Jedi.  This trilogy overall is a mess.  Very obvious that no real planning went into it.  This movie at least gives the ending a good shot and is generally is a success.",3.5
3075,Zane,"Dec 25, 2019","Movie had some awesome moments of fan service. But fan service is not plot. The movie’s pacing is a mess, and is non stop. It feels like fan fiction.

It clipped by fast and some of the scenes were confusing because there were no explanations for the “whys” or “what the hey happened”, but I was able to piece what I didn’t understand the first time around by seeing it for the second time. Reys lineage was a jaw dropping shock, never expected that.!!!! I loved the scene with “Ben Solo” Rey always cared for Ben Solo not his persona. I’m glad I went to see it and didn’t let the negativities sway me. In my opinion, the StarWars saga ended the way it should and was happy with the conclusion. I have been a Star Wars fan from the beginning days of long ago and it will forever be my favorite. I would give it a 5 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ and some ++++  An epic ending.",5.0

However, a huge bulk of this movie lacked meaning and character, making the entire story difficult to be invested in.

The next 3 prequels not. Well Revenge of the Sith was better. The Force Awakens I thought was great. It had the feel of the originals. The Last Jedi threw me off. It was good but it went off track to me. Luke wouldn't throw his light saber away or burn the Jedi library, his character direction I didn't like. It sucked! And Snoke offed so quickly. Anyway, this last one brought it back in where it needed to be. I really enjoyed it. I wish JJ Abrams would've directed all three for a more cohesive story. As big as this saga is and as popular as it is you'd think Disney would've made that happen.",5.0

3254,Steven W,"Dec 26, 2019",For those of us who begin the journey some 42+ years ago it was important to tie up some of the loose ends.  The movie did that. Again it stretched the survival rate of the combatants a bit but was well within the integrity of the story.  From the old westerns with the bad guys versus the good guys theme ran well over the nine episodes.  My daughter loved it as a three year old with me and completed it as a 45 year old.  Looking forward to the next chapters as Star Wars continues its journey!,5.0

The movie fittingly, and respectfully, gave tribute to Carrie Fisher through the scenes that were filmed before her death.  BRAVO!

The ""new"" guy-in-the-Chewie-suit did an EXCELLENT job ""giving life"" to Our Favorite Wookie.  What a shame we won't see him in any more Episodes.

Summary: 42 years after the debut of Star Wars, the saga has come to an end.  This episode has PLENTY of swash, boom!, and such to satisfy any Star Wars Fan.  There are plenty of ""Time To Cheer"" scenes, as well as a few Real Tear-jerker scenes (some are Unexpected - make sure you pack a lot of ""Kleenex""!), and there are enough Things That Quickly Go By that you may want to schedule a few viewings so you can Catch Them All, OR, wait for the DVD release so you can ""leisurely"" peruse the movie ""at your own pace"".",5.0

It's very sad what's happened to the entire Star Wars franchise.  I truly hope this is the last one, but profits will ensure they come up with some other lukewarm garbage to push on us.

Before seeing this, there was no version in which I thought I would not love it. I had complete faith in JJ Abrams, since he did such a good job on The Force Awakens. But instead of feeling joyful, celebratory, and hopeful as I had thought I would, I left the theater feeling numb, depressed, and having faith in Star Wars, which I love more than anything. Every other SW movie has a couple small faults, but everything else is always so incredibly well done that I immediately forgave it. But this film was rife with issues. It was so fast-paced, I could barely keep up, and it felt more like a Marvel movie, with little character development and no time for us to dwell on emotional moments, as all the previous films had. It moved like a video game, with the characters having to find things to keep the plot moving, and to fix the plot holes that new developments had just created.",2.0

3521,DELETED USER,"Dec 26, 2019","I loved the first two movies of the sequel trilogy, but the third movie failed to deliver on the themes and character arcs of the previous two films.

For example, there were several strong indicators of an impending Stormtrooper Rebellion... instead of delivering on this, the third movie told us (instead of showing us) about a Stormtrooper Rebellion that had already happened--but nobody bothered to mention before. (Oddly, the so-called ruthless First Order did nothing about said rebellion, as most/all of the rebelling company is alive, well, and stripping First Order ships for parts.)

Finn's arc in this film is that of Poe's sidekick--who occasionally acts as Rey's sidekick that she keeps leaving behind. Talk about disappointing! Of all the characters in the trilogy, his had the most potential. He went from being the one rebelling Stormtrooper (who may just herald the epic Stormtrooper Rebellion that brings down the First Order) to being... well, the sidekick.

Rose--essentially, the only engineer they've introduced in this trilogy--is completely sidelined for two new characters the film simply doesn't have time to develop. She deserved a greater part in this movie.

Rey's arc is retconned in the worst way possible, giving her a minuscule obstacle that the film tries to play as a major obstacle. If the goal was to give this character a true crisis, then it needed an actual obstacle--for example, Rey discovering that she inadvertently cause her parents's ship to crash when they left her, resulting in their deaths. But for whatever reason, they weren't willing to present her with an actual obstacle--a real personal crisis--so they try to repackage the one she already overcame in the previous movie (her heritage). I'm not sure if this was an unwillingness to take risks with the character, or an unwillingness to accept her character arc from The Last Jedi... or something else entirely. But whatever the reason, it was a big mistake.

But it's not just our heroes who are mishandled in this film. Hux - one of the few villains who survived to the third movie in this trilogy - is completely sidelined and given a subplot that makes no sense in terms of his character. Why did they introduce a new villain to take Hux's place? Hux was plenty villainous.  Hell, he deserved a chance to get back his villain legs after having them cut out from under him in The Last Jedi as part of the comic relief--why introduce ANOTHER new character (that the film doesn't have time for) when you've got a vengeful Hux all lined up and ready for his shot?

Then there's Ben Solo/Kylo Ren, whose arc was relegated to being the sidekick to Rey, despite the fact that he's supposed to be ""half the protagonist"". This was Leia's movie of the trilogy, yet they managed to completely mishandle her only living child's arc. That's just... rude, for want of a better term. To take a character as complex as Kylo Ren/Ben Solo and give him only a handful of minutes of character development, then tie off his story as a sidekick, is such a waste. 

Speaking of waste, let's talk the Knights of Ren. No, wait, let's not, since this film fails utterly in terms of delivery on the infamous Knights of Ren. The film didn't have time to present the Knights of Ren in a meaningful way on top of the end of a nine-episode saga--they should've accepted that and not included the knights at all.

The sheer number of plot-holes/senseless plot (and awkwardly threaded themes, many of which awkwardly dead-end for no reason) make this film feel raw and unfinished, and not in a good way. The storytelling seemed more interested in continuously upping the stakes than unfolding the plot in a meaningful way, resulting in lukewarm revelations, unnecessary (and lame) retconning of the previous films, and a general lackluster sense of action. (Hint: If you have to keep saying, ""if we fail this mission, everything we've done before means nothing"" -- then there's something wrong with the plot. You shouldn't have to keep reminding the audience about this.)

As the final movie in a nine-episode saga, it fails to deliver. It ends on an epically depressing note, which makes all nine episodes feel pointless. Its saving grace is the acting. The spectacle is alluring, but not enough to distract from the many flaws in the plot and failures in terms of character arc.

I saw both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi multiple times in theaters. I won't be doing the same for The Rise of Skywalker. Deeply disappointing.",2.0

It carefully stays away from any character-driven dialogue which,, based on earlier episodic ressults, is a good thing (Clone Wars, anyone?)and would keep it playing to ours strengths.

JJ Abrams new installment does it's best to rewrite the errors of the previous movie, but in doing so leaves plot inconsistencies and more to be desired. If JJ would've directed all three and told the story he started in TFA, this would've been an awesome trilogy. Instead we're left with a broken universe that needs repairing at a much later date with the proper scripts already in place. Go see it to right the wrongs of TLJ, but don't expect too much.",3.0

3638,chase,"Dec 26, 2019","The first two acts of the movie sprint through plot, starting from the opening scrawl where never-before-heard exposition about what's been happening is thrust at you with no explanation and seemingly no legitimate connection to the previous films. From that moment on the movie offers a nonstop barrage of eye-rolling moments in an attempt to barrel towards the final showdown. Manufactured moments with beloved characters end up being completely meaningless (c3po, I'm looking at you) and the main characters do nothing to make you like them or even believe they want to be in the film. The effects and cinematography is beautiful, but there is nothing here to to really enjoy plot-wise or make a person want to revisit the film. The best thing about my experience with this movie was the feeling of relief that this trilogy is finally over and can stop being crammed down our throats.",1.5

Did they try to do too much for one movie? Absolutely. Was the fan service out of control? Most definitely. Was it a bad Star Wars movie? Not at all. The special effects are top notch, the acting is great overall, there are some interesting (and very cool) concepts introduced. Its not the best, but far from the worst.

3739,Eli V,"Dec 26, 2019","Too much of The Last Jedi needed fixing and they really tried to appease everyone, but as a result it felt less magical.  This trilogy should never have been made without a real plan for all three films.  Clearly there was a disconnect between VII and VIII, and this created the challenge with this final films execution...Ill stick with just these four films, Episode 3, 4, 5, 6.  The rest was either poorly executed, acted and I choose to ignore them.  The action was great in this one, but story and plot not so much.  3 stars for the action and quality effects.",3.0
3740,Andrew,"Dec 26, 2019","I understand that it is science fiction. Needed to make that clear. However the last 6 installments hove been more fiction than I would like. Yes things were a little hard to deal with in the first 3 but they were ""real"" enough to enjoy everything. Somehow people just don't die in the last 2 episodes. Somehow Rey, with some training, finds the ability to... you'll know when you watch it. I can't give away the movie. 
   Now there were some good points about the movie. I liked bringing back Lando. I liked some of continuity kept from movie to movie. The effects were, of course, top notch.  
   Overall I think if you like Star Wars you will like this movie. You won't love this movie however and that is why I say wait and get it on Blu-Ray.",3.0
3741,Alexander,"Dec 26, 2019","A mess of pacing, wasted plot lines and call backs. However, Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley continue to be the heart of these films and Palpatine could make footage of paint drying a treat.

I think as fans and more importantly as people we need to take a step back and just thank J.J. Abrams and everyone involved and say thank you for giving us another Star Wars movie and for allowing us to once again get lost in the beautifully creative and imaginative world that George Lucas first brought to life.

3857,Brooke,"Dec 26, 2019","Having hated the last film, I realize there was much to escape from and/or try to explain with the new film. A lot is happening but I didn’t mind. I didn’t want long explanations. I just wanted the magic of Star Wars back and I feel this film delivered. There are some issues but I feel it had fun and adventure, good verses evil, and comedy where it should be with banter between characters and with the droids. No stupid Jar Jar type or many forced comedic moments. While critics are giving negative comments, I feel the film’s non stop action and simple explanations for the disaster of the previous film was entertaining and just enough to make you forget there was a flying Leia. There were some questionable issues but not enough to take me out of the childlike feeling of adventure that Star Wars created from my youth. As a huge fan, I was able to enjoy the story and adventure and for the first time in a long time, since the original trilogy, I felt like the magic of being in a galaxy far far away was back.",3.5

You won’t feel bored while watching this the story is paced pretty well and gets to action in the right spot with a decent amount of exposition. Now there are problems as some moments do feel a tad rushed and some holes do pop up I won’t spoil nothing here but you will notice it while watching it. Rey was actually really good in this and wasn’t boring like she was in previous installments. The knights of Ren were definitely something I was hyped for and was disappointed on how they were used in the movie, but you do see them in action at some point. I’d give this a movie a 8.5/10.

3957,Dan N,"Dec 26, 2019","Only giving 2 stars for the visuals. The rest was a disjointed mess of a movie with poor pacing, story, character development and dialogue. It felt like it was time to make a 3rd movie and these people just threw together what they could in order to close it out. There was not much regard for making a compelling movie. It seems their main goal was to simply end the trilogy. The beginning sequence was quite painful to watch what with the Mickey Mouse Club banter. The story is almost non-existent with the same formula we've seen for years. George Lucas is a brilliant and gifted storyteller and filmmaker. He can take a formula and weave a culture around many facets of the mythos. It's sad but Disney and the new Lucasfilm can't recreate his genius. I think most fans already know this. This movie is honestly as much of a mess as the 3rd Matrix. Remember that garbage? So, I agree with all the comments about Rise having super amounts of fan service but I would have sacrificed all of that for a great movie. The only concession I have to offer is that there are a few moments where the movie is fun and entertaining. Other than that, it's just a sorry shame and a huge disappointment. The only way that this movie could possibly be redeemed is if they somehow have an extra 1 hour of movie for the director's cut and it's a true epic. Then maybe I could warm up to this. I'm not going to hold my breath.",2.0

Not everyone will be happy, but suspend your expectation and enter with an open mind. You'll find a a film that is wildly entertaining, that carries the weight of a generation of fans and still captures the spirit of the original trilogy.  There is purpose to every character and the adventure is dramatic. As always it is visually stunning and aurally perfect. If you have the opportunity to see it in 4DX, I highly recommend it.  Though I would suggest experiencing it in Dolby first.  The pace of the film is very fast and honesty feels like there could have been 2 movies. As such, it would be though to take everything in on first consumption in 4DX. The 3D elements are very well designed and the depth of field is used extremely well. There are subtle objects that I missed in Dolby which pop off the screen in the 3D format. 4DX programming of the seats are spot on. The only way I would have felt more immersed would have been to experience it in VR.",4.5

To me, this movie was everything you want in Star Wars, I'm glad I spent my Christmas Eve with my boys watching it - and I hope they continue to invent new.

I watched the very first Star Wars in the movie theater when I was young. Yes, they were interesting, but there wasnt a lot of depth to the characters or any real powerful message in the storyline until Darth Vader died. That was probably my second best Star Wars movie.  

This one had for more meaning and depth (and good acting) than any of the others. Hands-down! Everything made sense with this one.  It gives a new meaning to the term hero.  The ending was fantastic! I cant stop thinking about it.

4121,DELETED USER,"Dec 26, 2019","The movie leans heavily on nostalgia and cameos. There is also a scene which is plagiarized directly from Return of the Jedi. JJ Abrams did a better job than Force awakens where nearly the entire movie was a plagiarized New Hope, but he still hasn't outgrow this lazy habit. There is also a typical Star Wats gimmick which I cant criticize without writing spoilers.  I also got the sense that the two directors (Abrams and Johnson) were fighting against each other, each trying to undo what the other did. This was most apparent in the case if Ren's helmet and Rey's past, the explanation given for the latter being very lazy and not artful at all. Finally, one of the themes of the movie was Rey accepting who she is and in the last line of the film she does the exact opposite. It doesn't land well at all. There were some entertaining parts of the movie, but it was overall disappointing. This is a solid watch when it is on cable TV and you have nothing else to do. Not worth going to theaters for at all.",2.5

Disney completely destroyed this series with the last two movies.   
If you like thoughtless bubblegum style movies that don't try to be anything but a mindless popcorn flick,  then this is for you.   If you've followed the series and want things to make sense,  then prepare to be massively disappointed.   
I did give it more than a star because there's so much to discuss with friends after watching the trash.",1.5

My only real negative comment is that I felt the pacing was off, the film seemed to rush by so fast I never felt a sense of accomplishment or victory when it ended, rather it felt like a very long movie trailer that I keep waiting for the full version of.",3.5

4149,Eric,"Dec 26, 2019","Felt messy and rushed. This whole new trilogy didnt need to be made in the first place. Thats the sad part, because episode 6 was already the perfect ending. By making the new trilogy, everything in episodes 1-6 were made irrelevant.... destroying the legendary characters we loved and looked up to, and turning them in to depressing realism (Luke Skywalker). We dont go to see Star Wars films for the realism!

The emperors return was so out of place and rushed too. You can easily tell it was never planned out from the beginning. Thats probably the other biggest problem with the trilogy... there was no roadmap. Im probably just going to look at the sequel trilogy as non-canon, like Im sure a lot of people will also end up doing. Such a shame though.",2.0

If you loved The Last Jedi, and thought it was bold, innovative film making that took the story in new directions, you aren't going to like The Rise of Skywalker. However, if you are like me, and thought The Last Jedi was a garbled mess that made no sense, then you will love The Rise of Skywalker. JJ Abrams had a lot of work to do in order to right the ship, and there is a lot of hand waving to dismiss key decisions made in The Last Jedi, but I was all for it.

I remember thinking to myself, ""self, this movie really seems to be trying to make itself relevant to what the youth of America & Europe are thinking TODAY.  I don't think that's how you make a timeless Star Wars movie like the first 3 were (episodes IV, V, VI.)""  Those 3 can be watching in ANOTHER 40 years, and people 40 years from now will like them.

While it had new characters, bringing back many of the ""old timers"" was a fun bonus. Not only is this an appropriate wrap-up of the entire series, it is also a very obvious launch-pad for many new story lines. Daisey Ridley probably had a lifetime career ahead of her if she wants it.

4290,Joshua,"Dec 26, 2019","First I'd like to mention that I 'liked' TFA and I 'disliked' TLJ. I don't read reviews prior to watching movies like Star Wars. I watch, form my own opinion, and then see how my opinion matches the other audience reviews. That being said, I LOVED Rise of Skywalker. Sure, not all plot lines and character arcs are nailed, but that doesn't stop RoS from being non-stop fun. Abrams did the most with what Johnson left him with. From breathtaking scenery to brilliant acting from the core cast, RoS is, in my opinion, one of the best installments in the franchise.",5.0

Last half made poor use of visual elements that could have enhanced the final battle and its emotional component to previous characters from the saga.

As a casual viewer it would be enjoyable but as a Star Wars fan i found it very mediocre. I wanted a ""Fitting"" ending to the Skywalker Saga all i got was an ending.",3.0

4324,Max Rebo,"Dec 26, 2019","An absolute trainwreck of a film. ""Fans"" who will as effortlessly gloss over all of its hardwired flaws as JJ Abrams and Chris Terrio did the plot will undoubtedly do so enraptured by shiny objects and flashing lights... because otherwise, this film lacks substance and heart. The premise of the story is utterly asinine, its ""reveal"" is contrived garbage, its breakneck pace is akin to a visual anxiety attack, they cart Billy Dee Williams into this movie out of sheer desperation even though the guy very clearly can barely walk or stand, Kylo gets absolutely yeeted which is tragic considering Adam Driver is the best thing about this entire trilogy, and JJ's counter-troll to Rian Johnson's TLJ is AT BEST juvenile and trite. There's so much to unpack here (and too much to work out in a review that doesn't span pages)... mostly because the honest, goodhearted idiot packed a bantha-sized dung ton into the film unnecessarily attempting essentially to make TWO movies in one. The worst of it, though, is that it ever needed to happen in the first place. Disney has been pathetically reactionary and insecure since acquiring the IP, intentionally distancing itself from the Prequel trilogy due to ""public opinion"" concocting the ultra safe soft reboot TFA, then reacting to criticism of that decision by letting Rian Johnson try to make a bizarrely nihilistic art film that created a divisive trolly dialogue between audiences.... just to then about-face again and allow JJ to reactionarily go out of his way to retcon the entirety of that 8th installment so much one can practically say Ep IX is both VIII and IX at once. All because Disney is so preoccupied with public opinion and how that impacts their bottom line, they can't just go out and make a stupid movie. Scratch that, they did. 

Listen, this has nothing to do with Star Wars or fanaticism or anybody's trolly Snoke theory. If you like shiny objects and flashing lights while you stuff overpriced popcorn down your throat regardless of the quality of what's on the screen, go knock yourself out. Nobody gives two holocrons what you do with your limited brain cell count. But if you value your time, money and bristle at the thought of immature snake oil salesmen insulting your intelligence without even trying to mask it while there are PLENTY of fantastic filmmaking out there (like Knives Out for example! Honestly, are we even sure anymore that Rian Johnson is the one to blame for the mess that was TLJ??), do as a storm trooper famously did back in 1977 and just ""move along.""

I can’t fully explain what was wrong with this movie without spoiling it. Dissatisfying character arcs, unexplained character changes, super powered force wielders, and also this movie felt like it either should have been two separate movies or half of the content should’ve been deleted. There were several moments, especially toward the end, when people in the crowded theater shouted, “WHAT?!” and the rest of the theater either laughed or agreed with them. (I was one to say, “Right?!?! WHAT?!?!?”) I have loved Star Wars for my entire life, and this movie was a very unfortunate let down. I have loved these new characters, and to see basically all of them end with dissatisfying arcs and added plot holes was disappointing. Continuity is a thing which exists in reality, but apparently that wasn’t a goal for this film.",2.0

In some ways it was nice to see a nod to some of the previous Star Wars films and their contents, but in other ways this appeared to be a re-hash of some of those movies and in some ways some of the scenes even seemed campy.  I was glad to see the series end and in some ways, for people of my time and age, this movie provided closure but it just could have been done better.",4.0

With all the questions Rainn Johnson piled up in The Last Jedi, it was no easy task to for JJ Abrams to answer them all, while not making it feel rushed. It may be my favorite Star Wars movie so far.

Unlike The Last Jedi, Rise of Skywalker is a more enjoyable, and in terms of the Star Wars fanatic inside me, it left me content. Of course, there were still some questions I had, but none major to the story line. In my opinion, it's the best out of the trilogy Disney has made. I don't feel it's fair to compare it to Rogue One or Solo because those two are a lot more straightforward whereas Rise of Skywalker is A LOT to take in. Of course everyone has their own opinions and this is mine, some other fanatics don't like the movie, but personally, I thought it was great.",4.0

This movie, by bringing back The Emperor, ruins both Luke Skywalker's & Darth Vader's character arcs.  Their sacrifice was now for nothing, since they apparently didn't defeat the Emperor.

However, the story of the relationship between Rey and Ren was more confusing than satisfying.  Their connection was displayed as supernatural, yet it turns out they aren't even related?!

And too much of it is derived from other movies from Return of the Jedi to The Goonies.  But the movie has some real emotional resonance for those who love Star Wars in general and those who have any affinity for this latest trilogy even after the disappointing Last Jedi.  J.J. Abrams has his faults, but he found a way to tie up all the loose ends to make good on all the promises he made with The Force Awakens, and even the promise of hope from the very first Star Wars some 40 years ago.",4.0

4589,Russ R,"Dec 26, 2019","I disregarded the negative reviews and went in expecting nothing, as if it were a stand-alone sci-fi movie, and still found it to be pretty disappointing. The writing is poor, the dialog weak, and the fight scenes (both saber duels and starship dogfights) are dull. It seems like the writers feel the only way to make the viewer feel engaged is to kill (or pretend to kill) one of the  significant cbaracters. It's hard to believe this movie came from the same company behind the Marvel movies, the Marvel movirs being of much higher quality on all fronts.",2.0
4590,Albert M,"Dec 26, 2019","After hearing so many critic/fan reviews I didn't expect to like this film as much as I did. The fact that the Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker has different directors is really glaring.  Key plot points and character development really take on a different tone from film to film and it can be very off-putting. I do think the ultimate goal of wrapping up the entire saga and leaving you satisfied as a fan of Star Wars was completed with this movie.  It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.  There is a lot of what they call fanservice.  But I think that it's done for the betterment of the series overall. The bridging of generations will prove to be satisfying and appreciated, if not immediately, it will in the years to come.  I really enjoyed this film and I look forward to seeing it many more times.

The last Jedi was an abysmal failure and this movie tries to rectify the many many mistakes of its predecessor, but it still must exist in the damaged world that was created by the prior disaster. This movie may be the best of the Disney Trilogy but that’s not saying a lot and it’s a shame that JJ Abrams didn’t direct the entire Disney Trilogy maybe then we would have got a cohesive story, thoughtful characters and avoided the giant turd that was the Last Jedi.",3.0
4663,Joel G H,"Dec 26, 2019","As they did in episodes 6 and 7, they rehashed plot lines from episodes 4, 5 and 6. I guess Disney told them to play it safe and go with a story that worked before. Also there were a few times where the plot made no sense. The plot didn't flow, it clunked along.

The characters lacked any depth. You don't care too much about them. The exception is Ray. She was well done. Also there was another one who was OK. (Name escapes me.)

I know this is supposed to be the last one but I doubt it, so I hope Disney will allow the next movies to move to a new plot line, there is such a big universe to explore and so many NEW tales to be told.

So go in with the knowledge it's about the same as episodes 7 and 8.",2.0

I found it to be exceptional and appreciated the imaginative exploration of the Star Wars universe. It was a thrilling ride. I will hold this one way up there among my favorite episodes. Top five. Maybe top three.,5.0

4721,Rafael,"Dec 26, 2019","Star Wars RoS was visually pleasing but the story left you with more questions than answers. The pace was too quick and clunky that you didnt have time to enjoy the scene or character arc before hyperdriving you to the next scene. Also had new whacky Jedi skills revealed that made no sense to come from such a novice. Force healing and Force Skyping was a lazy way to get this story together. I didnt appreciate the disregard to past episode precedent and cheapen the big reveal in the end. Entertaining...comprehensible, but they packed in too much in so little time.",2.0

However, the movie is somewhat hokey and a stretch to believe that characters who allegedly died in prior movies are still around in some form or another to cause havoc or save the galaxy.  Really have to suspend belief for this to happen - kind of like cheating to get to the desired movie outcome.",4.0

4935,Steve M,"Dec 27, 2019","While I've heard a lot of people saying, ""I would have done it differently."" or, ""This wasn't good, they didn't do the saga justice."" I only offer up for those people to get their film education and go to Hollywood and make the films they so readily believe they could do better with. This was the vision of the writers, producers, directors, editors, etc. 

I found the entirety of the nine films to be something that a community of people saw a vision of, pursued the vision, and made something that had never been done before. I don't even see something like this ever happening again anytime soon. The reason being? Well, the first three movies (middle three in the series) were the original vision of George Lucas. The rest were because he created a story that people fell in love with and wanted to see more of. 

This movie was great in and of itself. As Sid Field said, it's the duty of the moviegoer to suspend all disbelief for the duration of the film. I was thoroughly entertained and felt that there was a conclusion to forty years of a story that I thought would never be finished. 

I found it to be moving in some areas, angering in others, and thought provoking throughout most of the movie. My only wish was for there not to be a conclusion here as I want to see more of the development of the characters.

There's my two cents.",4.0

Heard this was not great, saw it anyways and was really really impressed with the way it was handled all the way through. Sure there are a few eye rolls in there,  but there are beautiful scenes, powerful acting and a few creative surprises so IMHO, overall, Job well done!",4.0

While it is not a strong ending to the trilogy or the saga, it is the best they could've done with what was given. Everything that should've been set up in the last installment but wasn't was provided to us in the form of rushed, annoying exposition filled scenes which ultimately were necessary. The action was intense, music score was great and most characters worked great this time specially Adam Driver's. In the end, it was a lot for one single film but it had to be done, it wasn't a perfect landing but it closed this chapter of Star Wars in a decent way. Hopefully next time they develop a roadmap and not just try to eyeball it.",4.0

5098,First L,"Dec 27, 2019","I loved everything about this movie except the ending which made no sense to me. From the start, I thought all Star Wars movies revolved around the Skywalker family but now the producers are making us believe that a Palpatine is the hero of this saga? It feels that the background story of Darth Vader & Padme and Lukes training as a Jedi was worthless or the story of Ben Solo turning to the dark side because he felt betrayed by his uncle. I guess what hurts the most is Ben Solos death after his redemption. This movie was a mess and too rushed. Im giving it 5 stars because I really loved this last 3 movies regardless of those movie critics, I am just in denial of my favorite characters death.",5.0

5232,ed a,"Dec 27, 2019","This movie was better than the Last Jedi, in my opinion, but it was a bit of a mess.  Its like they tried to make up for the last movie and crammed 2 movies into 1.  It races at break neck speed from one scene to the next allowing no time to pause and explain what is happening.  In the end, you are still left with major questions that never get answered like how did the emperor survive Return of the Jedi and why does he tell Kylo to kill Rey at the beginning of the movie but in the end he wants Rey to kill him?  There are parts that make no sense when you stop for a minute and think about it.  The scenes with Carry Fisher are awkward and feel so out of place.  Bottom line, dont expect that this movie is on par with the originals or even Rogue One.  It is not.  Save your money and watch it when it comes out on tv or Disney plus.",2.0

5290,Craig W,"Dec 27, 2019","The Rise of Skywalker made me smile.  That is where I end my pleasantries.  I do not have any gripes with the action scenes, per se, but the writing in this movie made me say WHAT?!?!  about a dozen times.  Biggest/MAJOR miss steep that the writers should have realized, was the entire ""spy sub plot"".  They should have taken  a Que from the Mandalorian.  In RoS, The rebels are tracking down information that a spy was feeding them, to help defeat the New Order. (this literally happens in ever star wars movie so no surprise here)  Once they get back to a safe location, everyone in the camp was almost yelling, did you get the Spy's information?  If it was a secret mission and it was so valuable, why blab it out possibly compromising the mission. Don't spice infiltrate both armies?  Related to that In a scene where the good guys think they are about to be finished, the character that helps, has to blurt out a line that is so clear to everyone, silence would have been the better alternative.  In contrast, The Mandalorian shows us how it is done.  By not saying anything. Actions speak a thousand words. In the first episode of the Mandalorian, he kills the robot without saying anything, and seeing its shell collapse to the ground, you understand exactly what happened.  I could break down 10 other scenes, but this would spoil the movie.  I do not hate this movie because of the actors or the story line.  I reference the Mandalorian because if it is done in the TV series, so why can't they do it here? 

I hate this film because it could have been broken up into 4 separate stories.  When you watch this, you start to notice where they could have rolled the credits early.  This brings me to an idea that some critics are trying to place on this movie ""movie saturation or burn out"".  I completely disagree.  As I stated before, if writing and telling a good story was the focus, instead of other ideas, then, for example, Marvel universe should have had box office blunders 11 movies before End Game.  (Weird right?!?)  Instead they all made ""home runs"" in relation to what they were.

TLDR Special affects cool.  Acting pretty good.  Emerson, top notch but the dialogue and story telling is a ZERO/ No Star.  A story without a foundation based on good dialogue will fail every time.  Tell a good story and it will not matter what else you put in the movie. Dialogue will win the hearts of every movie-goer and any mistake in acting or special effect will easily be forgiven.  Just write good dialogue next time, or take the ques from your TV series.",0.5

I feel like, more than ever, The Rise of Skywalker captures the true essence of Star Wars: the creation of a world and characters for the audience to fall in love with, to create a universe so unique that with every blaster shot, every starship jumping to lightspeed, every ignition of a Jedi knight's lightsaber, you become immersed in the world even more.

Plot points are often pointless or just dont make sense. Evening the opening crawl was weak. But as a star wars movie its awful.... better than TLJ, but still bad. There are often things that break the lore, or are just dumb. I dont totally blame JJ, because TLJ was such a dumpster fire. BUT this movie was not good. I would say see it once, but only once or you will start to hate it.",1.5

This was the best Star Wars except for maybe Episode IV. The story made sense, there was plenty of action and Rey's actions actually made sense throughout.

This film successfully annihilated everything the original trilogy, and the prequel trilogy (no matter how horrible), built/established with Luke, Leia, Anakin/Vader (the Skywalker's). The film felt rushed, the dialogue was sub par, and the ending ruined the Star Wars/Skywalker legacy. The only new character that I liked

5715,xman,"Dec 27, 2019","As expected, the action and special effects were incredible.
A woman as the lead protagonist for a change was great to see and she pulls if off very nicely. My objection lies with her supporting actors, I thought they were totally drab, weak, and lacking in stage presence,  In the end, you really couldn't care less what happened to them, they never won you over, (that's a big no-no) the lackluster reunion at the end had me thinking: ""who cares?""
For a movie of this magnitude, I'm quite surprised at the casting. What were you thinking???
I'm being generous giving it 3 stars.",3.0
5716,ridges54,"Dec 27, 2019","Good movie, especially for those of us who have seen this grow from A new hope in 1977. I think my only complaint is that you almost have to keep up with EVERYTHING star wars (cartoons, books, comic books, and movies) to fully understand everything that's going on and accept what the characters are doing. Gets to be a bit much. Maybe I'll go back and fill in the blanks. Could be fun.",4.0

5723,Billy Mac,"Dec 27, 2019",Overall it was just another sci-fi flick distant from it's original roots. It is a modern day politically correct construct. It has lost the original mystery and intrigue surrounding the The Force.  2 hours and 35 minutes fighting to stay awake.,2.0

5728,Laura  L,"Dec 27, 2019","As a Star Wars fan for 40 years, I absolutely loved it.  It was a powerful, emotional, and exciting end of the saga.  Ive grown to love these new characters, Rey, Po, and Finn, just as much as I did Leia, Han and Luke.  The nostalgia in the film - old friends, old ships, familiar place, and voices from the past, brought tears to my eyes.  I thought this ending was perfect.  The screenwriters and directors had the painstaking task of tying up 8 episodes that have played out over four decades - as well as pleasing Star Wars fans both old and new.  Like most things in life, you can never please anyone.  There will always be unhappy people who like to find fault and complain.  Dont listen to them - like Rey, choose to find the good, and you will find that this might be one of your favorite Star Wars films - and the perfect ending to this wonderful story that started in a galaxy far far way ...",5.0

Pros: Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley shined.  Their story arc of courage, honor, redemption, and sacrifice was well played.  So much so that for me it tipped the scales.  Without this... this movie would've been really bad.",3.5

Some jokes were good. Like the banter about Poe being a spice runner, humor had its moments. 
However, a complete travesty of writing. It's like 16 different people wrote this movie & didn't speak to one another. Too much fan service, thrown together with 1980's tacky glue. We had the wake with TLJ, now the funeral with ROS.

NO SPOILERS

The Bad -
It ended up being a shitshow after all

It was weird

The cutaways shot solely for exposition with a character straight up telling you what was happening were jarring and lazy

The pacing was terrible, you could not follow or feel anything

They senselessly retconned so many previous Star Wars movies with the new powers and the return of an old character, which killed what the previous movies did

I mostly watched this movie because I heard Wedge Antilles (Ewan McGregor's uncle Denis Lawson) was finally back and everyone knew Lando was back

I won't say names, but ""Nice flying, Lando""? Are you kidding me? They never even got their name mentioned or got introduced to other characters after everything they did? No last heroic moment for them? I would not even known who that was had I not watched interviews and knew the person's face, so why bother having them on the set at all?

They missed an opportunity in one scene to use important characters faces rather than just their voices

So many plotlines from this movie alone that were never resolved

My friend predicted the plot with the most subtle differences maybe six months ago, so he's got the Disney formula down and that predictability is a problem for such a poorly done movie

The whole movie was basically a response to The Last Jedi, which at least was paced slow enough so I understood what the themes were and felt something, this time they were just shitting on Rian Johnson and I might as well hate The Last Jedi as much as the next guy, but come on Disney, it was your fault for not planning out your franchise and letting that happen
It is no secret that when you're writing and directing you can easily get caught up in your own ideas and looking back at TLJ reminds me of David Benioff being the entire writing team for Game of Thrones, and we already saw how bad that could get at the time TLJ was in preproduction
In any case, this was the most uninspired way out of the last movie


The Good-
I liked when it was over

As always, Palpy steals the show-even though he’s in for no more than 10 minutes. You could tell that with Leia dead, they struggled. Kept dragging with that-felt more like Weekend at Morty’s that flick with the dead body being dragged around the Hamptons. Very sad & poorly done. Unlike many others, for once Rey DID earn her stripes but in fits & bouts, like everything else these days. I actually felt bad for her. The last Skywalker himself not who you think surprised & delighted. However even that, felt disjointed. 9/10 scenes raced to the end until they were shoved off the directorial chopping block. A lot of thought was put in—until it wasn’t. Disappointing only because the speed & fan service can’t make up for all that. That sentence right beforehand is a good example. Overall, fun, but a lot glaring issues to actively overlook while enjoying. Good job, JJ-you tried very hard & it worked. Just please go back through after & watch the whole thing through.               As an aside, irony has no bounds it seems, because I had a dream about JJ Abrams, with him making something for a “proto-network” whatever that means. Maybe CBS?

5925,Angela C,"Dec 27, 2019","I grew up with this franchise in my life. I really enjoyed this film. The actors were good, I didnt get too lost in the story. However, there were some blaring issues with it that took away from the story.
1) I did not like the death of a certain character. It happens when every character has seen the error of their ways....they die.
2) Why cast Keri Russel if youre going to hide her face the entire time? Tribal markings or tattoos on her face wouldve been better. JJ.A simply shouldve given that role to an unknown who needed it more than KR.
3) Rey is not a  Skywalker, not in the bloodline. I did not agree w/ the decision of the character taking that last name
4) Finn never reveals what he always wanted to tell Rey. He brings it up. It is brought up again, then forgotten. Elementary screenwriting mistake.",3.5

It reminded me of when I was a kid playing Star Wars with my friends and we’d always make up the story on the spot trying to one-up each other with the new greater powers we’d imagine into the existence of our game. I think some people will have a major problem with this, but as for me who grew up with this and for all the kids who think like this, it’s nostalgic. Good overall movie. Feels incomplete though...",4.0

Rise of Skywalker completely blew me away.  It was a very satisfying end to the Skywalker saga.  The inclusion of past characters was done in accordance to the lore established in the prequels and not just randomly thrown in. 

There were some aspects of the movie that I could have done without though.  Mainly that there were stakes for the universe as a whole, but the plot armor was too thick for certain characters.  Losing some people in the context of this movie would have made it more impactful.  My biggest complaint though is that they fumbled some lightsaber color consistency.",4.5

It was a great ending to a series we probably all started as young children.  There were a few things that obviously stood out that I could have done without but I definitely will go back and see this a little more relaxed now that I know what happens.

There was only 1 good light saber fight scene during the last 20 minutes of the film. I felt that the story premise didn’t really tie in to the franchise, but rather acted as a indirect sequel to the previous 6 films including the 2 most recent main Star Wars films. The very end did send off in an interesting way with some symbolism. Just another carbon copy of Return of the Jedi in a way. Go see it for yourself",2.0

Bottom line is ... I liked it. I liked it more than I thought I would. I had read some spoilers (shh, don't tell!) and I was thinking, no way they were going to tie it all together. And while it didn't have a pretty bow on top, I'm satisfied. I think they need to give this time line a rest for now though. Maybe in a few years some movies in the Star Wars universe with some totally new characters. It is a very interesting place after all. Ask the Mandalorian.",3.5

6069,E,"Dec 27, 2019","Plot moved at breakneck speed, leaving little room for any character growth. This overstuffed movie may well be its own trilogy as the film moves along from scene to scene at ludicrous speed. Things happened because the plot demanded it or because of some convenience. Any character not named Rey or Kylo Ren/Ben Solo did ... stuff. The writers gave Rey an actual trial that she must overcome, but she overcomes it with relative ease because of plot convenience.. Bens redemption felt rushed and undeserved.. The final battle felt hollow. Every payoff felt meaningless. Carrie Fisher deserved a better tribute. The actors gave serviceable performances, but they couldnt save this film. Overall, a terrible, disappointing shell of a film that undoes the other two films in the Disney Trilogy, the Skywalker legacy, and the Star Wars mythos overall.",0.5

I'm not sure just how deep I can go without spoiling the movie horribly, but I ultimately liked the resolution. I left the theater excited and wishing to see more with Rey, so that was a good sign.

Digital of Leia was so ""awkward"" - they wrote the script around what they had vs. what was important to the story. Too many ""ghosts"" (really?). They tried to get everyone in there - many gratuitous cameos nothing to do with this story, thin as it was. Disappointing. Just short of putting me to sleep. Paid extra for special screening (theater effects) and it didn't help. If I was watching it at home, would have turned it to a different show.",2.0

There were a few different details sprinkled in to try to make it different, but the story was basically the same. Finally, I didnt feel the emotional connection to the central characters like I did in the other trilogies. When Han Solo died in episode 7, I was sad. Any of these charters could have died, and couldnt have cared less. I wanted to like these movies, especially since I was also slightly disappointed by the pre-quels. Hopefully, this is the last one. In my opinion, Star Wars has turned from a cinematic labor of love into a warehouse cash cow.",1.5

6227,Anna W,"Dec 27, 2019","If this is really the end of the Star Wars saga it was done tastefully. The film stuck to its ongoing theory and did not disappoint. I love how it closes with the new generation and their possibilities and how it gave closure to the past generations and what they accomplished. And emphasizing on how the young and the old can work together to learn from one another and achieve greatness. I’ve been a Star Wars fan since the beginning and it’s been very nice to see a storyline that gives you the reality of hope for the best to come but with difficult decisions along the way staying dignified. I appreciate so much that George Lucas started these films keeping things free of crassness, disrespect and filth while still exposing us to the realities of life and the choices we make. It’s been a real neat experience to see these films first as a kid and now be sharing the moments with my own daughter. Thank you Star Wars for giving us nothing but the best! I will remain a loyal fan.",4.5

6246,ChemE75,"Dec 27, 2019","Im not a highly critical Star Wars fan, certainly not an expert at all the nuances of the various themes. I enjoy them all as more or less groups of films rather a seamless cohesive saga from start to finish like the hobbit or lord of have rings. So this film satisfied a number of my high points such as enthralling action focused around a certain quest. Again, some questions were answered and some issues were resolved, while others remain and new ones become apparent. The unanswered questions and potential new issues leave the door open for future films. I think this installment was entertaining, thankfully not geared to only kids but not too deep for kids to enjoy. The history of Rey is a bit muddy so I can see some better clarity of her lineage in the future - too much was important to know more about but not well defined. Time constrains for a single film made it impossible to go deeper in this film so my hope is to see it come in future films.",4.0

It delivered on all the promises & mysteries raised in Force Awakens w a thrilling adventure, balanced by the core trio we've come to love (played so brilliantly by their respective actors), that takes us to the four corners of the Star Wars universe & deep inside Sith lore. We meet a score of fantastic new characters (Babu Frik!), see cool new lands & learn that Force powers are indeed beginning to rise in your average SW citizens. Kylo Ren's arc actually gets a powerful resolution. Rey's parentage question gets an incredibly satisfying answer. And Han, Luke & Leia get a highly emotional (if sadly shrift) send-off. There are a few nitpicky things we might've changed, but they're minor. All in all, it was a brilliant Star Wars film, and solid close to a trilogy that hit a bumpy road in Last Jedi. We definitely recommend.",5.0

It answered enough questions for me for the past 10 films, it had Easter eggs all over the place, as well as throwbacks to the previous movies, TV shows, books, comics, etc, EVERYWHERE.  But it also raised a whole buncha questions too – which I like.  This creates an environment where MORE books, movies, TV shows, comics, and such can weigh in and tell stories. So now my kids can grow up consuming even more SW offerings and create their own memories for the things they love while I get to keep my own from the OT, Prequels and Sequels.

6404,Brit,"Dec 27, 2019","Spoilers: It felt rushed, as if they had a checklist of topics to touch base on and they did a poor job connecting everything. The red power ranger seemed like a good character until she gave that line about Rey being OK. You don't just beat up my colleagues and then we are all good, because you said please. Also, why would she want to run away with Poe, after whatever incident caused her to hold a gun to his head? Let her stay mad at him. The scene with Leia sacrificing herself was lacking. I felt nothing for her whereas when Han died I slipped a few tears. I understand the passing of Carrie made the movie tricky, but she laid on a slab. There was nothing moving about it. No voice on the wind, no fleeting motherly love helping him tip his balance, just a realization that she passed. Maybe I missed something, that was a water scene after my bottle of water had already been drunk. There were some neat fighting scenes, and some nice fan-based fun slid in.",3.0

I remember seeing episode 4 in the theater, realizing my expectations for film had been changed forever. Sadly, this final episode falls far short of the expectations created by the first film. I went in with very low expectations  and was still disappointed. Does everyone have to cry every few minutes? How is that heroic or inspirational? The characters were so busy emoting that I didn't have to feel a thing. I was thrilled to see that Dennis Larson was talked into an appearance and that they didn't ask him to create a maudlin moment, but other than that I didn't feel that much of the movie was very memorable.",2.5

6576,Scott D,"Dec 28, 2019","The Last Jedi did a lot to damage my enjoyment of the Star Wars universe. JJ Abrams does his best to correct the mistakes and plot holes carved by Rian Johnson’s failure, and he succeeds fairly well. The movie moves along at a breakneck pace, and the big reveal is given up early on in an attempt to tie things together. Abrams relies heavily on playing to nostalgia and catering to fans of the original trilogy, and it doesn’t go unnoticed as it’s done with a heavy hand, but despite some of these issues, it’s still a very fun and entertaining film. Would watch again in the theater, which is more than I can say about Last Jedi.",3.5

The final scene is out of Wagners Ring Cycle Gotterdamerung. The ring (light sabers) return to the elements ( here the sands of Tatouine) - but you had to know the reference to get that - and the age of the Gods/ Emperor Siths is over replaced by the age of Man / Rise of Skywalker.",4.0

I do wish Carrie Fisher could have had her moment, but that's not the movie's fault. I also wish Rose Tico had gotten more attention, which is the movie's fault.  The Jedi feats are beautiful, although some of the effects were slightly overdone. The scenery is beautiful. The nods to various media installments of the EU are wonderful. I liked the idea of Palpatine's weapon/threat, but I think it was overblown to the point of ridiculousness. The ending was nicely nostalgic, but a bit clunky.  An enjoyable installment in a beloved saga, if not the most polished one.",3.5

I love how JJ brought in elements from the previous films, video games, and cartoons. I think the haters are trying to create false narratives and create drama. The weight of the film and expectations are high. I think JJ and the cast rose to the challenge, brought the series to a close, and left the door open for future films. As much as I loved it, I don’t think I’ll take my three young kids to see it (ages 9, 6, and 5). Unlike A New Hope which was family friendly, this film has some dark action sequences, violence, and language I don’t want to purposefully expose them to yet. Revenge of the Sith had some dark themes too. I think this film takes some of that a little further, but it has a lot of charm and humor that you would expect. The ending leaves you feeling good, hopeful, and satisfied. It’s a definite must see for old fans like me and older kids!",5.0

Daisy and Adam perform phenomenally, carrying the entire film with their entrancing performance. General fans will likely leave satisfied from the movie. However, hardcore fans, may not be as satisfied due to the multiple plot holes and jumped over background details that leaves a true fan wondering why, or whats next. Like any movie, every fan can not be happy. Sadly, the movie fell short for me due to a few disappointing character arcs, and hopefully the Skywalker saga has not closed its doors quite yet, dreaming of a Disney+ series.",3.0

It made it hard to settle into caring about the characters again or to get any traction in caring about the story itself. When the actors were allowed time, however rarely, to do something more with their dialogue than simply spit it out amidst scene jumps, we were drawn in. I wish there had been more time taken to invest in the characters and the story rather than the excitement of battles and exploding things. The last half helped as all the reveals began to engage the audience, but the missing build up of the first half made the enjoyment incomplete. Id still give it 3.5 stars for the quality of acting and visuals and for the excitement of the end, but I miss story telling of the older films.",3.0

6845,Chazoo B,"Dec 28, 2019","My whole family (Dad, wife and two college girls) loved this movie.  It is true to the Star Wars mark, has plenty of excitement and visual effects. The flashbacks to previous episodes bring back great memories.  Sure, some of the humor is a bit corny, but we've come to expect that and appreciate it by now.  If you are a Star Wars fan, like we are, don't miss this final episode from the original nine episode series.  It brings closure to the entire legacy and is a whole lot of fun viewing.",5.0

Its nothing new in terms of taking the series in an entirely different direction, but really, this trilogy was never going to be anything beyond more Star Wars.

Some weird dialogue but that comes with every star wars movie (originals included). It did have its faults plot wise with setups having no payoff but they had some pretty clever tools for storytelling that only star wars can do. Makes me wish this trilogy was actually planned out beforehand like Disney has done with Marvel but it was a satisfactory ending to the sequel trilogy.,4.0

A minuscule part, that doesnt take away from the overall greatness of the film. Whether youre a Star Wars junkie or not, its a fantastic movie to see in theaters. Nuff said.",5.0

I thoroughly enjoyed it. There is 2 parts in particular I'm not fond of, but that would reveal spoilers so I will keep it to myself. All in all I am proud of how my story ended.

6915,Mark P,"Dec 28, 2019","The internet likes to complain. Star Wars fans doubly so. Does it gloss over a lot of stuff from The Last Jedi? Yes. But if one thing is clear to me it is that critics aren't fans of the Star Wars universe, but just the movies. So many of the things complained about as being convoluted are actually in Star Wars lore. Star Wars has been more than just the movies since the credits rolled on Return of the Jedi. TROS embraces a number of these things in an engaging and entertaining way. Ignore the naysayers and decide for yourself.",4.0

Rey was a strong character and deserves a ton of credit for her performance and Adam Driver also was outstanding!",4.0
6934,Robert S,"Dec 28, 2019","Yes, the film tried to do a little too much, but the Star Wars fan base frankly drove that more than JJ Abrams, after the Last Jedi response.

Even if Luke didn't get the girl, there was a feeling like things were ending, a sense of hope. But this ending left Rey, Po, and Finn in a friendly but you know there are inner relationship issues that are not resolved.",3.5
6954,Shawn J,"Dec 28, 2019","The visuals were stunning in the battles and there was a fair bit of action. the story, however, leaves much to be desired after the sad state of the plot at the close of The Last Jedi. When this film starts, there already isn't much to work with, so most of the major twists and turns of this film feel forced. The ending is a so-so payoff for this cast, but a far cry from a decent end to the Skywalker legacy.

Honestly, if you're interested in seeing this, wait for streaming or Blu-ray for this film unless you are a diehard fan of The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.",2.0

We got to see so much more of other characters like Finn and Poe and I very much enjoyed that. There was pacing issues and there was a lack of build in the third act. Enter this movie ready to enjoy the magic of Star Wars not to pry it open with logic cause you wont have a good time that way.

7010,John H,"Dec 28, 2019","A satisfying movie for Star Wars fans. JJ's task had a high degree of difficulty - create a compelling story with old footage of Carrie Fisher, solve plot points at odds with each other because of TFA and TLJ, and honor three trilogies. The Rise of Skywalker isn't perfect, but it gives fans who have supported the Star Wars universe for 4 decades fun and poignant moments with old and new characters. I thought the end of Leia's story was fulfilling - defining her as a Master Jedi. The relationship between Rey and Kylo had a great pay off. The chemistry between Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley was easily the best part of the new trilogy. The Rise of Skywalker addressed the point of lineage and bloodline - a theme throughout the 9 movies. Family is who we choose and we are not predestined by blood.",4.5

Gets to the point where you don't believe anything that happens in the film because you know 2 minutes later it will be a ""gotcha"". They did the best they could repair the damage to the story line by the Last Jedi. For me the comedic moments fell flat. It was still a beautiful Lucas Arts film with effects and sound. Would have been nice if all 3 movies had been competently planned out with a coherent story line and not the haphazard work that was done on this trilogy. If they don't get competent writers and directors for the future I hope they don't make any more Star Wars movies. I gave it a 2.5 stars but without Lucas Arts production skills I would give it 1.5",2.5

Abrams to be the stellar director he is, I get the distinct impression Disney couldnt keep their dirty little fingers out of the script.

They cover a lot of ground in this film, but never take the time to let each discovery sit with the characters impacted (and the audience). There are moments of goodness in the movie, but this is the first time I walked away from a Star Wars moving feeling there were no great moment(s) to pull me back in for more viewings which is truly disappointing. While not awful, I walk away from the wrap of a saga that has been in my life as far as I can remember just feeling like the true Star Wars fan deserved better.",3.0

7178,Jeremiah Reviews,"Dec 28, 2019","It had good elements that should have been explored further, but overall, felt very contrived and rushed for most of the running time. There were a few standout scenes, but the rest of the film ran together after a bit. While I personally thought the film was better than the 2nd film, The Last Jedi, this film caps a mediocre trilogy that never really got off the ground or does anything groundbreaking.
Most of the new characters were bland caricatures that never really espoused any sort of tension or empathy from the audience, and ended up being static throughout.
While Daisy Ridley is a great actress her character, Rey, had an arc that was dull and boring. There was hardly any evolution of her as a character, and she continued to breeze through obstacles put in her way without any struggle in the slightest.
Finn had a great and interesting hook in the Force Awakens, but the writers never really capitalized on his upbringing and he ended up never being utilized properly.
Poe Dameron felt very tacked on, but still had some likeable charisma from Oscar Isaac's skill as an actor.
Kylo Ren was the only character that I felt was somewhat interesting and had a memorable character arc. His arc is wrapped up in a somewhat satisfying way in Skywalker, but some serious blunders and missteps in the plot quickly destroy any satisfaction gained.
Overall, Skywalker is a meh film. It doesn't stick with you, feels rushed, and has scenes and crater-sized plot holes that will make viewers say ""WTF?"" out loud or laugh ironically as my audience did during my viewings. If you must see Skywalker, I would wait until it is invetiably released on Disney Plus or some other platform. Don't waste your money.",2.0

How did Rey become so knowledgeable about the Force, and where did this healing power suddenly come from?  I suspect Mr. Lucas deeply regrets having sold the franchise to Disney.  We'll never know how much better the final trilogy would have been if Mr. Lucas had made it himself, as he originally had planned.",3.0

Daisy Ridley is about the fittest actor I think I have ever seen on screen other than Schwarzenegger.,4.0
7202,Mitchell,"Dec 28, 2019","An entertaining disappointment, this just finished the reimagining of the original Star Wars trilogy (i.e. - episodes 7-9 were just following the plot of episodes 4-6 with new characters who never really made that connection with each other or their audience).

Just as we have have pop music that follows certain marketable patterns, we have pop movies. Although visually stimulating, here is nothing iconic or worth repeating in this movie. Nor is there a logical or consistent  flow of events in this last trilogy.",3.0

7205,Kenneth H,"Dec 28, 2019","Disappointing plot and lack of any semblance of originality, this edition of the Star Wars franchise lacks any development of a story.   The reemergence of Palestine without any background seems contrived for the purpose of having an antagonist.   Reys confrontations with Kylo Ren appeared predictable with the surprise ending not really living up to expectations.   The plot and ending parallel that of Return of the Jedi.   Clearly not much effort on the part of the writers and director.   The movie reflects Disneys market driven fingerprints to produce a consumer product with mass appeal using elements of pc and intentional pandering to corporate demands diversity were evident  without any real addition to the story.   The CGI was the only good aspects of this film.   It may be time for this life long Star Wars fan to retire if this is the best that can be offered.",2.0

On the other hand if you go in expecting it to be an amazing story and epic climax to the Star Wars story you will be disappointed.——— The entertainment is fun and lots of neat scenes. JJ Abrams does a good job. —————————————But as I said earlier, it’s unnecessary. It feels like the writers got confused with Harry Potter and Voldemort, especially when they arrive on the Sith Planet. ——————————————————————— The Jedi powers far exceed even Master Yoda’s abilities, almost along the lines of X-Men’s Magneto or some Avenger’s superhero. ——————————— Of course it goes with out saying that it is all predictable. It makes you wonder if someone can even come up with another story line then heroes are beat down, rise up, over come insurmountable odds, are victorious! ————————————————  The best part of the story is Kylo Ren’s redemption. He was actually an awesome good guy. Loved seeing him fight as a good guy.——————————— Of all the new Star Wars movies, this was the best for sure.  —————— All in all, you are always hoping for it to win picture of the year as did LOTR’s Return of the King. —- But alas, no luck with this one.",2.0

The movie is perfectly entertaining and has many if not all of the great components that would delight even the most critical fan of Star Wars. I think the expectation that each movie has to out-do it's predecessor has gotten us to a place that is a bit insane. The movie is just fine. There are surprises, lots of dazzling effects, and has a good plot. Sure NOT EVERYONE is going to love it, but I am big fan of Star Wars, and it was perfect. Go see it.

Why are Storm Troopers so stupid and easy to kill? What is the purpose of their silly plastic armor that does absolutely nothing for them? I thought they were clones, but that seemed to change. Why do Jedi powers vary so much?  And why are they used differently depending on the movie? Couldn't Darth Vader use the Force to bring the space ship that escaped with the Death Star plans on Rogue One the way Rey used it to control the space shuttle that supposedly had Chewy in Rise of Skywalker? How come no one eats, drinks, or sleeps during any of the movies? Why do some Jedi die and return while others never return? Really, it's just ridiculous, yet we love it so much. Hard to explain...",3.5

7303,Austin,"Dec 28, 2019","Spoilers before reading this!! The only thing I enjoy about this film was that it pushed a little deeper into the lore of Star Wars than the first 2 films in this trilogy. For instance when Kylo Ren was searching for that 'map' to find the Sith home planet was very well done, no extra fuss just got right to the point. Also Palpatine being the one behind Snoke made sense as to why he was easy to kill in the second film since he was only a force puppet that palpatine was controlling. And how all the Sith was in Palpatine as all the Jedi was in Rey was also a cool moment too. But I believe instead of using 2 light-sabers to block Palpatines lighting at the end of the film it should have been her strength with the force alone like how Yoda stopped his lighting with his hand in episode 3. I feel like if you had all the force strenth of all the fallen Jedi behind you you wouldn't need a light-saber let alone 2 to stop the power of all the Sith. I feel like that was Disney trying to make the light-saber 'cool' again when they've already been cool sine we first saw them in the 70's. Also that ground team landing on the side of the capitol ship with the horses was stupid. I would have rather seen a classic battlefront style scene of boarding the ship and fighting their way to the bridge so the 2 former stormtroopers could see one of their former generals face to face. I feel like that would have been a better moment and would have solidified their new friendship. 
On a side note I think Lando was great in this movie, he brought just enough nostalgia but wasn't in your face with ""you guys remember me from that thing 30 years ago?"" I'm glad he wasn't completely necessary to the films plot but wasn't completely ignored either. 

All in all this film was enjoyable but there is a lot I would improve on, also the editing department needs to learn how to not do fast cuts. It's super distracting and by the time you are almost invested into a scene it cuts to something else before you can understand what is happening.",3.0

7355,Bobby,"Dec 28, 2019","My biases, so you know where I'm coming from: I love the original trilogy and Rogue One, appreciate the prequels in hindsight especially Revenge of the Sith, and had big problems with the tone and execution of The Last Jedi. TLJ left me feeling hollow and sick, and I'm one of those fans who wanted JJ Abrams to ""right the ship"" with this final movie. So, cards on the table...

The Rise of Skywalker got a lot of things right: the humor, the frantic pace, the fist-pumping action, and great chemistry between the four leads are all worthy of Star Wars. There are so many call-backs and references to the original and sequel trilogies some are obvious but many are subtle and rewarding for repeat viewers. In addition, the acting performances in TRoS are probably the strongest of any of the other ten movies (yep, even better than Empire Strikes Back, which is saying a lot).

Adam Driver in particular is outstanding. Billy Dee Williams's Lando is spot-on, and gets one of the most moving lines in the whole movie that, for me, finally did the emotional leg-work of connecting the sequels to the original trilogy and letting me fully buy into the new characters and their own story. Maybe best of all, it gave me closure on some of the things that I most disliked about The Last Jedi and, in my opinion, was faithful to how TLJ ended while bringing the story back into a more familiar emotional tone and ending with an epic, mythic, satisfying bang.

And of course, TRoS has its own problems. It can feel like a jumbled, frenetic mess, especially the first time you watch it. On second viewing, it hangs together better. There are glaring logical problems, particularly with how little time it seems to take every character to get from Point A to Point B and with how Palpatine was able to be in the position he was at the start of the movie. Palpatine's master plan, motivation, and apparent change of plan in the third act make sense in broad strokes, but get more confusing the more you think about them and compare them to the earlier movies.

Some people have criticized the ""big reveal"" in this movie as being lifted straight from Reddit fan theories. I counter that by saying that there are maybe four or five possible directions that they could have chosen from, given everything we know from the last two movies. And all of those possibilities have been analyzed to death by fans! Anything else would have been just crazy, pulled-out-of-a-hat nonsense with no setup. Abrams and Terrio made their choice and it works about as well as any other choice they could have made.

Over all, I loved this movie and recommend it, with caveats. Go in expecting a fun, crazy space opera roller coaster ride and you'll be rewarded. Go in with your own ideal script in mind and you'll be bitterly disappointed.",4.0

This movie was enjoyable to watch, but at the same time also seemed to be lacking due to the fact that it very obviously tries to redeem itself of the wrongs that Last Jedi committed. It’s as if in this movie The Last Jedi never even happened. There were also quite a few plot holes in this movie as well, but I will not spoil anything here. I discussed this movie with a friend of mine when we got out of the movie and we both agreed that this felt like a four hour movie crammed and beaten down to fit in a two and a half hour movie. This movie REALLY rushes the story along. Before you have a chance to take in a scene and really check everything out, BOOM next scene. All of this aside this movie to me was a simple turn your brain off and enjoy sorta film.

7421,Jaws01,"Dec 28, 2019","Well you can say this trilogy probably wasn't well planned out especially when you have two directors with different ideas and Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy allowing these directors to do what they wanted.  Might as well have continue to allow Colin Tremorrov have his input on the ending of this trilogy. What was so different about his ideas that caused him to butt heads Kathleen Kennedy and ultimately leading him to quit or get fired. 

I'm going to go as far as to say that the prequel trilogy is better than the sequel trilogy. George Lucas's prequel trilogy isn't perfect either but still planned better. He knew what he wanted in his movies and it does show. Maybe if Lucasfilm or Kathleen Kennedy had a better vision, there would be no point for this review.  The fans deserve better for a sequel trilogy that are supposed to be follow ups to the Original Trilogy. Maybe I would of preferred a George Lucas sequel trilogy. I will miss his vision, his direction and his creativity.",2.0

7426,DELETED USER,"Dec 28, 2019","No one will dispute that the original trilogy was better than the prequels or the sequels, but what makes the sequels so much worse than the prequels is how the sequels damage the character arcs of the characters in the original trilogy.  Lacking a coherent storyline, the plot of the new trilogy has to tarnish the originals in order to drive a lazy story in the new films.  Rise of Skywalker continues this trend.",2.0

I love that Carrie Fisher wa used in the film, but it was so forced. They made the scene around her unused scenes and it showed. This movie just killed all the lore that happened with return of the jedi. How the hell did they bring back Palpatine? That was so stupid. All film are subjective, but this was a disappointment for a star wars movie.",1.0

7470,Robert M,"Dec 28, 2019","Unpopular Opinion: The Last Jedi was the best of the new trilogy. It was daring, new, surprising, didn't treat you like a cat entertained by a laser pointer. It was the exact opposite of this movie. Rise of Skywalker was predictable, more of the same, unambitious, terrible pacing, and nothing that happened had any impact, and it undid a lot of what The Last Jedi did right. When something bad happened in ROS it's completely undone 5 minutes later. Oh you think a character you cared about died? I wouldn't worry about it. Our heroes are in a tight situation? They will completely turn it around and earn another gold star sticker. Clearly JJ is playing it safe and trying not to send a large infantile portion of the Star Wars fan base into a tantrum. Not to mention he treats us like we have severe ADHD. The pacing is crazy. You go from one scene to the next and a machine gun pace with no pause to let anything soak in. Still, it's a decent movie with great visuals, some laughs, more screen time with some of our favorite characters, and some other redeeming qualities. You should still see it to complete your viewing of the trilogy, but you if really care about Star Wars and want to see it grow... This conclusion to the series it'll probably frustrate you a bit.",3.0

It was fun and entertaining. Without spoilers I would say it is a patchwork of fixes of all the wrong that Ryan Johnson did that in the end, left more unanswered questions. So much stuff to fix and not enough time to push the story along at a pace that gave all the characters proper development. A fun roller coaster with non stop action the whole time but I don’t like scavenger hunts. I think the shortcomings of this movie are more Ryan Johnson’s than JJ’s. There was too much to fix.

Don't want to spoil too much, but there were a few things at the end that weren't needed and kind of undermined a bit of what this trilogy meant to me personally.

7607,Craig,"Dec 28, 2019","It hit some nostalgic notes, some humor, and was visually appealing. But overall it was pretty flat. The humor often derailed an emotional reaction. The motivations were murky and often contradictory. It sort of cleaned up the mess left by the previous film, but the ultimate resolution felt forced (no pun intended, and if they'd done a better job of using The Force, that would probably have made a better film) and as though it was thrown together at the very last minute from footage left on the cutting room floor. Star Wars isn't dead, but I don't think I need to go see the next one in theaters.",2.5

7629,DELETED USER,"Dec 28, 2019","In making *Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker*, Disney presented JJ Abrams was with an impossible task: Create a coherent, reasonably satisfying conclusion to a 40-year long saga while not only addressing the major narrative missteps of the previous film but also taking those questionable elements and weaving them into the story such that their existence, while not glorified, could, at the very least, be justified as these elements served as a means by which we have reached this final chapter. Do all of these things, Mr. Abrams, while also bringing to the screen some of that JJ magic we've all come to expect from your work (even though we realize that your heart belongs to that *other* Star franchise.)  Oh, and have it be at least good enough to contribute to filling this huge money pit created by our questionable management practices, perhaps having far too many cooks stirring this Star Wars trilogy in the Lucasfilm cauldron. 

Given the situation as laid out above, I can't bring myself to being too critically tough on this film. I'll leave discussion of the particulars of the movie to other reviewers more capable than myself. As for my personal, unsubstantiated feelings about *TRoS*, I thought it was fun, fast-paced, had great set design, fantastic effects, and some good acting. In other words, it thoroughly exceeded my expectations. But that's usually the case when we witness the achievement of the impossible.",4.0

7635,Chris K,"Dec 28, 2019","It was a good wrap up to the other 8 films.  There were parts that were highly satisfying, other parts not so much.  I think there needed to be more of a romance somewhere that could have continued into future movies, but I also like Rey as a stand alone character.  I think there is this vague competition for Rey's attention by Finn and Poe, but there was really no electricity there.  Finn now seems to have a connection with two other characters now, and Poe and Rey seem the closest to having anything besides the connection between Rey and Ben, but Ben is now dead.  Does he come back? Do we even want him back?  He killed Han.  Don't know if audiences can ever forgive him for that, even if Han did.  It was interesting, but not sure I loved it.",3.5

I don't know his name but he is a white guy and thinks too highly of himself. In any event, There was a lot of retro and you need to know the saga to understand the picture. There were also a number of surprises going forward. Don't want to be a spoiler.",4.0

7806,FN1977,"Dec 29, 2019",Its like if your favorite football team made it to the Super Bowl made a few cool plays but still lost 10K-14. Its like Disney didnt have any plan for this trilogy and let the director for the last Jedi do whatever with no consideration that theres going to be a movie following his. JJ did the best he could with what he had but it felt forced and nothing felt earned.,1.5

It was okay, but I didn’t like the way that Kylo Ren/Ben Solo’s character was handled.  An explanation of how Palpitine had survived would have helped, too.  The ending definitely didn’t feel like the end.  It seemed that another installment could follow.",3.5

7819,CBD,"Dec 29, 2019",This last installment of the saga picks up right where the last left off while keeping a good pace of plot development. There were very few moments that dragged so the audience stayed riveted throughout. Be ready for the big reveal but also leave wondering one big question that was never truly answered. I still don’t know how people survive being on aircraft in the atmosphere without any oxygen masks.,4.0

Have not been real happy with the Disney version of Star Wars.
Exception being ""Rebels"". That was good. It followed the canon pretty well.
This episode was just OK. The sets,the CG and,of course, the music, where great. However,the plot had holes big enough to fly a star destroyer thru. The character development was flimsy,at best.The ending was confusing and pointless. How many times did Ren die and come back to life?
Over all ,it was truly meh.",3.0

7837,DELETED USER,"Dec 29, 2019","This was a great sequel to Force Awakens. Still bitter we had to sit through the drivel that was Last Jedi but glad that JJ was able to cobble something together from the ashes of that dumpster fire of a film and essentially erase all of what it attempted to do. I appreciate the fan service; we earned  it. I look forward to one day reading memoirs from JJ or someone else describing what really went on before filming, the panic the Disney execs felt when they saw their prized franchise disintegrating before them. This film is a salve to those wounds but it doesn't heal everything. If you're a true fan —and by that, I mean one who hated Last Jedi with the fiery passion of a thousand suns—-then you will enjoy this film. You might not love it, but you'll shed a tear...for Leia, for Luke, for those characters who should have had the backstory they deserved and not the one that defaulted to them. You'll see the iconic words come up on screen and realize you don't quite care what happens, you just want it to be over.",4.0

Happy that they did not pursue any romance in this film, I felt like it wrapped the Skywalker series up in a box with a big bow on top!  Spoiler - the death of Ben felt correct to me, the Skywalkers each sacrificed themselves for those they loved Anakin for Luke, Luke for the Rebellion, Leia for Ben and Ben for Rey.

7894,Kelly Tbaum,"Dec 29, 2019","When a movie franchise has been with you since you were 8, the constant tragedies that befall favored characters enter a separate but personal level.  The attachment and tears are real.   For one to ""take-over"" the franchise without the same depth of investment and to treat it like an isolated entity is a disservice to the fans that have endured over the decades.  Star Wars was incredibly....special and for countless reasons.  
The actors are not at fault.  They did their job and did it well.  The lack of choreographed lightsaber duels we have come to recreate were completely lacking.  Attention to detail fails for Abrams again in many areas of the movie.  Yes, it was pretty cool to hear the voices of those lost in the battles for freedom, but that doesn't occur until the rolling disappointments culminate into to a ludicrous failed finale. I certainly do not wish to ruin anything here but will say this...that was totally unnecessary and one of the most absurd conclusions.  After 4 decades of loss, one  success would have been appropriate and appreciated.  Particularly this unique pair.  Shameful.  Abrams, you have ruined it.  Poor show Disney.",2.0

It is a victim of the modern cinema that value twists, subverting expectations, and fan service references over solid story telling and character development.  Hollywood needs to read some Joseph Campbell.",1.5

A lot of the movie jumped from one scene to another, leaving me confused as to what happened or why it needed to happen. The first half of the movie felt unnecessary and the 2nd half was boring and predictable. The ending was just stupid and actually kind of pissed me off. The ""plot twist"" was predicted years ago and wasn't very surprising and overall the movie just felt like it was half-assed. There was nothing memorable about this movie except for the fact it'll be the last main line Star Wars movie (to which I say good riddance!)

As someone who grew up on the OT, watched and loved (despite their flaws) the PT, and had high hopes for the ST I must admit that I'm severely disappointed in the Rise of Skywalker and the ST overall.",2.5

8106,Michael,"Dec 29, 2019","If you were a fan of “lat Jedi”, then you won’t like this one. They undid a lot of the political statement they were attempting. In fact the entire first 30 min right on .01 of the timer was entirely moving fast and trying to quickly mend the faulty holes the last movie produced. The story was ok considering they had to bring back the main ultimate villain to help save the franchise. In the end, it was entertaining and the left over footage of Lea prior to her actual death was pretty well integrated. In addition there were quite a few cameos of the original cast which paid homage to the original story and characters.  Although it was entertaining, it seemed like they packed too much in one movie, perhaps it could have been more evenly paced with 2 movies. However, I assume that was the original plan for “last Jedi” and for this movie to be the conclusion, now they only had one movie to put it all together... in fact, you prob could not even see “the last Jedi” and go straight to this movie and it would have been fine.",3.5

JJ Abrams does an admirable job of trying to bring the focus back to the three main characters and their story together - Finn, Rey and Poe - while paying proper homage and respect to the past. Sure there are some plot holes here and there but the story wraps everything up in a nice bow... familiar yet fresh and fun.",5.0

It was as frustrating to watch as the Trump election.",1.5

I found the movie entertaining and the sound was amazing even considering that I have combat damage to my ears. This movie is not ""The Expendables"" it is Star Wars. Having seen all of them prior to viewing this movie, I was pleased with the end result. The way it ended was almost exactly like I was hoping it would end. But that just makes this another story to be told. The only thing I didn't care for was the 30 minutes of commercials before the movie even started. That is why I only rated this 4 stars.",4.0

8270,Branden Watts,"Dec 29, 2019","Everyone who grew up with Star Wars is going to go see this film. Maybe it's because we want to remember a more innocent time in our lives when we believed in magical things,  or maybe after Lucasfilm botched the prequels, we hoped that the machine that is the Disney corporation would honor the Star Wars brand. Either way, you're going to buy a ticket and watch the movie, whatever the reviews say. Disney knows this, so they never had to worry about whether or not the movie would actually be good. I gave it 2 stars based on the cinematography, CGI, and sound editing alone. None of the previous installments in this franchise were known for their thespian achievements, and 9 follows the trend. I am sure that a decent part of the disappointment that I felt at the end had to do with my expectations. It is unlikely that anyone, even Mr. Lucas could've written a Star Wars film that would have ended the final installment to my inner child sense of wonder and innocence. That being said, this movie was utter rubbish. The plot felt like I was watching a video game - the heroes have to find the widget in order to unlock the McGuffin, in order to defeat the main boss on the last level, which is doable, if the dialog flows in a natural conversational way, but I had the concious thought while watching this movie that this is the essence, the very definition of Disneyfication. They sacrificed plot and substance for big effects and blatant (and very cheesy) attempts to get an emotional response from the loyal men and women who grew up with these films. Like I said, I don't know that anyone could have nailed this challenge, I only know that I expected better. Much better",2.0

If you haven't seen the movie yet, don't watch the easter egg previewers because they got more than 1/2 their theories thrown out the window.  All the characters played their parts well showing doubt, uncertainty, strength and resolve.  I don't know why people gave this movie 2 stars.

I would also say that it kept the tradition of Star Wars trilogies as in the 1st and 3rd are the best and the 2nd is slow and just trying to advance the story to the eventual finale.",4.0

8368,Kevin,"Dec 29, 2019","Being a longtime fan of the franchise, the movie has a lot of deadends, unexplained story development, and plotholes....LOTS OF PLOTHOLES. Paying attention to this movie for details really just makes the experience worse and it plays out better if we had the minds of a younger generation watching the film. If you somehow look past the plotholes and the rest of the connected star wars story, the movie itself is fun, magical, adventurous, and everything a star wars film should be. the plot is parallel to return of the Jedi in many parts so be aware. I would have given this a 2.5 but the star rating doesn't go by halves.",3.0

8383,AY,"Dec 29, 2019","As the final installment of the Skywalker saga and the sequel trilogy, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a flawed but fun spectacle that rewards fans and can excite casual moviegoers. Its story leaves little time for moments to breath and relax and its surprises underwhelming but the characters, both new and old, are entertaining, the action and suspense exhilarating and John Williams' score continues to captivate them beautifully. While this may be the final word in the story of Skywalker, I look forward to seeing what comes next for Star Wars.",3.5

8416,Owen,"Dec 29, 2019","The movie has a terrible pacing to it, and feels as if they were trying to cram 4-5 hours of plot into 2 hours. The plot was also very unenjoyable. It felt like it was a National Geographic program showing off landscapes on different planets. I did really enjoy the light saber battle on the destroyed death star though. It felt like a combination of the intensity of the fighting from the prequel trilogy and the emotion of the original trilogy. That was the only section of the movie that I really enjoyed though. It just felt like they should have gone a different direction with the movie and thought through the script and plot more. It feels like this movie is very rushed and Disney should have taken another year to revise the script and make it feel like a real Star wars movie. Instead, they made a movie that is completely just fan service for the general audience(lots of action).",1.0

The Rise of Skywalker does a solid job fixing the holes created from The Last Jedi, but it still falls extremely short of the finish line to fill any fans desires.

It was quick and had no character buildup, Hux was the spy for a grand total of 5 min and gets blasted and what is up with them leading an assault on a Last Order ship on horses and in outer space AND not freezing, while Leia got blasted out of her ship and froze and used the Force to come back in. Like it made no sense whatsoever and even seeing it 2x, 3x, 4x or more, it won’t. It was just plot hole after plot hole after last minute background thrown in, and yet, JJ did the best he could. I would of been ok with him splitting the movie into a 2 part Episode 9. 6 hrs or 7 to tell the ending correctly and tie up all ends BUT, Rian Johnson happened. UGHH!! I wanted to give this movie the benefit of the doubt BUT it was too much, too little, too late to fix so much that was introduced and not explained. I mean, FN-2187 was teased as being force sensitive, the boy at the end of TLJ was force sensitive and yet nothing came of it. Come On!!",1.5

Any clip of which could have been a compelling hour of television. The second half was an emotional rollercoaster. My wife and I wiped tears back and forth onto each others sleeves.",5.0
8473,Michael,"Dec 29, 2019",It doesn't have the feeling of an exciting or an interesting plot line. It appears to go step by step of recreating old Star Wars moments for nostalgia's sake.

Choppy
Badly written

The final installment of the saga does it's best to pay service to the loyal fan base and negate some of the garbage pile of mistakes in TLJ.

8552,Richard H,"Dec 29, 2019",It was OK. The best of the 3 new cast Star Wars but that doesn't say a whole lot. The best part of the design was that JJ Abrams recognized the utter train wreck Rian Johnson made out of the arc in Last Jedi and took the best action he could: he pretty much just ignored that it happened and moved on..,2.5
8553,Disappointed Viewer,"Dec 29, 2019",I think it was slightly better than the last movie. it moved really fast and it still did not feel completed. I feel like this was a rush job to try to fix the storyline from the last movie.,3.0

8570,Jeffr,"Dec 29, 2019","The end of the saga was entertaining as JJ Abrams brought back so many iconic characters. The boldness of Rey, the self serving nature of Kylo Ren, and the pluck of PO, Finn, and the Rebels made the last in the series worth watching again and again. The sagas subtle messages all come to full view. Critics be damned, this was a well made conclusion to an epic tale. Thank you George Lucas!",5.0
8571,P Bean,"Dec 29, 2019","This was the perfect wrap up to the Star Wars saga. Highly entertaining. Anyone who says it was ""just OK"" or even ""not that good"" has missed the point of the entire saga! Go see this now!",5.0

8579,Jen L,"Dec 29, 2019","It was exciting and kept my attention for most of the movie. It’s when you go back to analyze what happened...that’s when you realize how many plot points were pulled out of nowhere and how the trilogy wasn’t completely thought of as a whole. It was entertaining to watch in the theater but I’m not sure how much rewatch value it has, especially compared to the other trilogies.",2.5

The name “rise of skywalker” really doesn’t make a lot of sense other than it was probably their goal to redeem Luke somehow which only mildly happens... the space battle is tough to pull together, this is the perfect example of how easy it could be for Disney to print money with this franchise...

This one, I've already mostly forgotten.",2.0

8656,MikeL,"Dec 29, 2019","Spoiler alert- I really enjoyed the retrospective approach to the film but there were quite a few rules of the film's and mythology of the series that were broken- a Jedi spirit catching a lightsaber?  light speed skipping?  transporting objects through the Force? How did the Final Order send all those star destroyers around the Galaxy for the final celebration scene when they were in one location for the entire film?  It seemed that a lot was made up just to move plot points and show off movie ""magic"".  Overall the film was fun as Star Wars should be - so be prepared to giggle and marvel at the effects but know that the film isn't great.",3.5

8711,DELETED USER,"Dec 29, 2019","Exhausting to sit through when you don't really care about the characters, the outcome or the lack of story that makes any sense. The editing is so frantic and every scene is  shot to make it seem like tons of dramatic action is going on, which it is, but none of it means anything since there are zero consequences or stakes for anyone and you realize the jumping from one pointless action scene to the next was a deliberate choice to distract you from asking too many questions. The only good thing about this movie was Adam Driver and Palpatine had a badass cackle at one point, the rest was at best bland and at worst boring. I also found myself wondering who exactly the audience is of these movies since it can't be kids, and people my age with enough nostalgia for it have been fed up since the prequels. I would avoid seeing this in the theatre, it's not as offensive as the last one where I wanted to get up and leave but it is thoroughly a waste of time and money.",2.5

8755,jay La Bella,"Dec 29, 2019","Overlooking basic errors due to overwhelming nostalgia for the franchise. Storyline sinkholes in and  missed opportunities for character development plagued what has been heralded to be “the end” of the saga that touched so many from childhood wonder all the way up to religious faithful adulthood. I was blinded by my love for familiar faces and iconic images/themes to try to set aside my anger and fear for the future of this beloved world as a result of this final chapter. With mixed feelings for the new sequels I had great hope that ROS would answer my questions in a meaningful way that paid homage to the history without doing so cheaply. Special effects and sound were great as always, but there is a reputation for ILM to be THE BEST at this game so this element merely met expectations when combined with disjointed storytelling and continuity concerns. Perhaps the complexities of this new direction (Palpatine’s return) could have been better explored within a 2-part format like a “Deathly Hallows” and the like. I can’t say I didn’t have great appreciation for this feature but that was not at all accomplished by this film on its own. Must see for die hard fans, but this smells ripe with dark Disney forces that failed to stay true to Lucas’ original plans for the story. While pleasing those raised on the franchise at face value, ROS will undoubtedly split audiences of loyal fandom.",3.5

If you are a Star Wars purist I would say give it a pass but if you like the current Star Wars story lines it entertaining and will keep you engaged until the end.

8805,DELETED USER,"Dec 29, 2019","I thought this movie was a very solid ending to the Skywalker saga. It was incredibly enjoyable up until the ending. That is the main disappointment I had with the movie. The ending felt incredibly rushed and as a fan of Reylo and Ben Solo, I was crushed when he ""died"". I put died in quotation marks, because it isn't entirely clear what happened to him. He disappears and is never mentioned again at the end of the movie, or shown as a force ghost. It was very odd that Rey never really shows any emotion over his death as well, considering they were revealed to pretty much be soulmates a few minutes before. I have to hope that there is an explanation about Ben, but there should have definitely been a scene at the end at least showing him in some way, or at least showing he wasn't forgotten. I feel like we still need/deserve closure for his character in some way. He's such an important character, and I feel like they just brushed him aside at the end, after giving us so many beautiful scenes with him. I also thought the movie could've easily benefitted from being three hours. It would've given it more time to breathe. All in all I think the good out weighs the bad in this movie, Daisy and Adam's performances and relationship were highlights for me and I would definitely recommend it!",3.5

8807,Michael,"Dec 29, 2019",Meh is about right. Cool lightsaber fight scenes and D-O(?) The cute new drood character are the bright spots. Mediocre story the downfall. Hardly a satisfying end to a several decade long epic. Annoying how they tried to piece together dialogue of Princess Leia from previous recordings to keep her in the movie more. It seemed to lack continuity. Sad that they had flying storm troopers and horse creature and snowmobile toy opportunity scenes beyond mention. It was just kinda bad.,2.0
8808,Wade,"Dec 29, 2019","They finally made a good Star Wars movie in the newest trilogy! Its a pity they repeated the plot from return of the Jedi in many ways, but still good despite being derivative. They also need to calm down with the CGI in the new movies. Im assuming that Mandalorian had a much smaller budget and thats why it feels like a Star Wars movie rather than just giving small children motion sickness from all the camera movement and CGI. I dont want to be all negative though, the best part of this movie is that the story really made me like the other two movies In the final 3 more. You see why they set up certain things in a quirky way to support big reveals at the end. So I guess I would say, not a fan of JJs movie style, but huge fan of the story in this movie!",4.0

Daisy Ridley was captivating throughout, Adam Drivers (Kylo Ren) affection in the Last Jedi, and into the Rise of Sky Walker for Daisy (Rey), was evident. I enjoyed John  Boyega (Finn), Oscar Issac's (Poe), and Chewy's connection and will to defeat the Palpatines and have Rey's back.

8994,Brian Mistark,"Dec 29, 2019","SLIGHT SPOILERS:

So I can see why people hated it. Random jumps in power level of Rey (kind of a lack in character development strength wise, she did an obstacle course  not much earlier than her big fight scenes and was sort of sucking even BEFORE she got distracted). Scenes later she is doing some very strong force feats and showcasing exceptional saber skills. At least be consistent with the skill and power level so we can say between last movie and this one, she gained a lot of strength rather than unexplainable power differences in a matter of a week or two. On top of this, they turned her into a big Mary Sue. They discredited everything Luke did just because, so they could be like we are progressive! Look, we made a female the strongest even more than Luke!. The his is slightly annoying.

Anyways though, if you can get past that and just accept that the emperor was one of the most powerful Sith to every exist with a master who taught him how to manipulate Midoclorians into creating life, then it makes sense he is still alive. The power level of Rey is still questionable here and there, I wish they had shown the force ghosts of all those who supported her in her fight against the emperor. This would have really bridged the gap and made the ending more enjoyable and easy to swallow. The representation just wasnt there though. Otherwise, this movie was really good. A great story if you can learn to just let go. It was easily the best of the trilogy. A lot of complex and intricate ideas that made it interesting. Great fight scenes. I almost wish Rey did strike down the Emperor and become the Sith Lord to save the rebels though, then become a grey Jedi with Ben. That would have made a better story TBH. Still good though.",4.0

At least in the first movies each character has strengths and weaknesses they worked through and together. Oh yes at the end was mentioned or worked into storyline or  just dropped it in 'they need to work together'. Like a novel ...by page.. you need to say this and page...you need this.

What I have to give is the visuals have always been on par with a modern look and appeal.  The rest is a mess of pandering, nostalgic nods, and a train wreck of a story looking to pick at the publics pockets once more.  This movie itself wishes to wash away sins of the past as it blasts off into light speed for the entire runtime (seriously, flesh and bone pancakes at the pacing of this movie).  The movie in the span of two and a half hours pretty much copies the exact plot formula of the original trilogy with a mixture of insecurity, deception, and revelation.  In the end, were met with another big budget film filled with the new incomplete and uninspiring cast Disney wishes people to love and merchandise from and old has-beens to only help woo people into the theater one more time.",1.5

I teared up numerous times when the movie referenced previous movies and payed homage to classic characters. While perhaps not a perfect standalone movie, it certainly was a great closer. Even my teen daughter and a friend  of hers who hadn't seen many Star Wars movies thought it was amazing. It is certainly a spectacle, and I am glad I saw it in the theater in 3D. There's a lot to take in, even with the 2 and a half hour run-time. While I wasn't overly wowed by previous outings, this one delivered the goods. Recommended.

With that being said, the storyline did not fail to deliver.  The effects were amazing and the plot didn’t get stale although it seemed long at times.

9307,Finn-Again,"Dec 30, 2019","All in all, a decent comeback from the debacle of The Last Jedi.  Filled with plot holes and illogical inconsistencies, but the film made an effort to honor its roots.  The revelation of Rey’s true lineage cane way too late and, in conjunction with the arc of Ben Solo/Kylo Ren (the only character with any sort of truly transformative story), could have formed the crux of a genuinely awesome epic/trilogy.  The movie thankfully jettisoned much of the “woke” nonsense of The Last Jedi and focused on telling a good yarn.  Overall, if you’ve been following the Star Wars saga, it’s worth seeing the conclusion in the big theater.  Could have  been better, but after the dreck served up last go-round, Rise of Skywalker is more than most fans expected.",2.5

And No one has an issue with Princess Leia causing her sons death?

9402,James F,"Dec 30, 2019","Loved this film! I understand that many have criticized it, and some have complained about aspects of the plot being contrived or too overstuffed with side stories. However, I think that the movies overarching messages about staying true to oneself and sacrificing for others (even in the darkest hours) do shine through. A few scenes of violence may disturb some of the youngest viewers, but my son (6 yo) and daughter (13 yo) watched it with my wife and me as a family, and they handled those instances very well. Overall, I loved this last chapter of the Star Wars trilogy of trilogies. In all fairness, though, I also loved The Last Jedi as well as The Phantom Menace, so my opinion is rather biased.",5.0

Like — I liked seeing a lot of the old characters. Some surprises.  I dont think they had to kill off Ben and it didnt make sense that he translated. Like Vader although he turned good art he end he should have had the funeral pier. I liked how they handled Leahs passing. 
Last but not least. —    Well this chapter is over and I will always have the opinion that 
Disney should have followed the books instead of going off on a new story like.",3.0

9556,ed stone,"Dec 30, 2019","thankyou to Disney for maturing the characters and the movie as a whole past the gimmicy antics and one-liners that plagued episodes 7 & 8.  still a few of these moments, but overall Ep. 9 had more of the gritty realism that we loved about the original Star Wars. That said, the fantastical compression of time scale was ridiculous and unbelievable to the point of being a distraction from enjoyment of the film.  Taking months worth of events and journeys and compressing into 16 hours! was something of a high-jump for the proverbial shark... particularly felt during the ending.",3.0

Some bumps along the way (Ep. 1,2), but this concluding installment was simply epic.  I was emotionally invested in all that transpired, and Ray is just a boss.  Great hero story, redemption story, good vs. evil story.  Will 100% watch again.",5.0
9561,Richard,"Dec 30, 2019","Without going into any spoilers, I think this was a great way to cap off the past 42 years of Star Wars films (granted only 9 main line movies came out in that time frame).

Its not perfect by any means, but a movie doesnt have to be perfect in order to be amazing. There are always things they could have done better, even in the original Star Wars trilogy. While Star Wars: Episode IX isnt one hundred percent perfect, I thought it came pretty close. There were a couple small things that I thought could have been done better or given more explanation, but overall I was blown away by how amazing this finale to the Skywalker saga is. Its incredibly well done, and had me extremely engaged and satisfied from start to finish. I wont spoil anything, but I will say that I am extremely satisfied with what JJ Abrams, Lucasfilm, and Disney have put together. It celebrates Star Wars from throughout the years while providing a satisfying and epic conclusion to the new trilogy and the Skywalker saga. Go see Star Wars: Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker! You owe it to yourself to see this through to the end and experience this amazing film!",4.5

9627,Christopher C,"Dec 30, 2019","Just finished Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker...

My thoughts: #NoSpoilers

I didn’t hate it.
I didn’t love it.
It was neither a bad film or a good film.
It was jam-packed with action from start to finish. Great visuals, great acting. Excellent throwbacks to films before it. 
However, it lacked cohesion. Too many subplots made it confusing and left way too many questions unanswered. Some of the deaths felt cheap and hollow. Some characters were given far less screen time to make more for others. Many things didn’t make any sense, and there as never a bother to explain them.

It’s not the worse film in the franchise, but this was a terrible ending of the Skywalker saga. JJ Abrams reinvigorated the franchise, continuing the Skywalker saga, and ended it’s story with a plot so full of holes, it could pass for Swiss cheese. 

See it, or don’t...it doesn’t matter. True fans of the franchise will see it. Just be sure to take an Advil before you do. 

I give it 3/5 stars. I may be in the minority (or majority depending on the company) but I was very disappointed with the film.",3.0

9657,Jedi Master Disapointed,"Dec 30, 2019","The title “rise of Skywalker” makes little to No sense, considering everyone related to a Skywalker is gone by the end of the movie. Rey can call herself whatever she wants, doesn’t change the fact she’s not one. The pacing is all over the place, maybe the intention was not to give the audience enough time to think about all the convenient new force powers and characters that were not even mentioned in previous films but now are thrown into this movie like they’ve been their the whole time, utterly ridiculous. In my opinion it’s very clear that Disney had no vision for SW when they started making these movies, unlike what they’ve done with the marvel movies. There is absolutely no cohesive story or tone to these new SW movies. As a longtime fan I couldn’t be more disappointed. My only hope is that Disney learns something from the Mandalorian and focuses on more SW content for their app instead of continuing brainless dribble like Rise of Skywalker.",1.5

No time is left to allow you to digest moments. The writing was lazy in the end and it is sad to think about the potential impact it has when you think about the old movies and how those characters develop with the story.

9777,Rammozart,"Dec 30, 2019",Great film.  It tied up all the loose ends with many surprises at every turn.  Do not listen to the critics.  Disney honored Star  Wars with another addition and final chapters to the the nine episodes.,5.0

They could have edited out about 30 minutes of the super cheesy jokes and save me the time.  The movie felt very rushed, Rey did not empower the womans movement in 20 whatever year it was.  If the ghost of Skywalker can levitate star ships I guess there is no point in dying.  Save your money and order some Starbucks",1.0
9779,Michael,"Dec 30, 2019","Unable to capture the spirit of Star Wars. In the end, the hero’s couldn’t pull off the most critical mission of all making us believe them. Too many twists and turns that had no relevancy. Seemed to not at least try to make sense. Disappointed.",2.0
9780,Benjamin S,"Dec 30, 2019","Frustrated with the pacing in the first act. Rushed introductions/new characters not given time to be fleshed out (I understand setups for spinoffs, but the attention given felt impatient). Lots of expected callbacks, quotes, cameos, but given that this needed to be one, and a final, film, lack of details in between is a disappointed loss in momentum. I enjoy the cyclical narrative and the belief in balance of light/dark, but reliance on the format for specific conflict and climaxes made the arcs and “twists” predictable. There is heart and the Star Wars spirit in Rise of Skywalker, but it could have been more.",3.5

9792,Shannon,"Dec 30, 2019","It’s a bit disappointing compared to the last movie, mainly because the storytelling is rushed to make time for the action/battle scenes. The best parts of the movie are when it slows down and focuses on Rey and Kilo. It felt messy and rushed, like the characters were just jumping all over the universe. Having said that, it’s worth watching to see how the story ends. Plus, there are many nostalgic cameos and nods to fans. I’m sad that this series is done.

A pinch of nostalgia, good action, plot makes sense in universe, and it's overall very enjoyable.",4.0

9860,Donovan,"Dec 30, 2019","I liked that the pacing of this movie seemed more driven and not start and stop like The Last Jedi. It was a thrill ride throughout all of it and treated the loss of Leia (Carrie Fisher) very well. While there are parallels to Return of the Jedi, some of the callbacks were deliberate to connect, but also this was a hero's journey, same as in Return and so there can't help but be some parallels. Still this was certainly it's own movie and not a simple remake/rehash. It also acknowledged some of the ""issues"" that fans had with The Last Jedi and gave at least a cursory explanation for why they weren't going to repeat those actions. A satisfying conclusion!",5.0
9861,Sarah Q,"Dec 30, 2019","My expectations were pretty low, given all the fairly negative reviews out there - Dont let them get you in a bad frame of mind! Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The visuals are stunning, the storyline is cohesive (even if there are a few things left unexplained), the humor brings the right warmth to the story in a way that made the original movies beloved, and the focus is rightly on the relationships between the characters. I think 9 was better than 8, and definitely better than 2 and 3, and perhaps even with or better than 5 - certainly in the middle of the pack when rating the movies within the series. It is also my opinion that Kylos story arc went where it needed to go and could not have gone another way. I do agree it was unfair to Roses character to largely leave her out of this movie after investing time developing her character, but finales tend to focus back on the core and her character didnt rise to that level. Overall a solid and satisfying finish. I plan to see it again.",4.5

Those claiming that its disjointed, or doesn't flow, obviously didn't pay too much attention to The Last Jedi. It doesn't tie up all the loose ends, and those complaining about that don't understand that it was never meant to. This film was designed to put a larger story to an end, and open the SW universe to all of the other smaller stories that can now be explored. Some people are taking themselves too seriously with their reviews. In the words of Maximus Decimus Meridius, ""Are you not entertained??!!""",3.5

The later portion dealing with the relationship of the Emperor, Rey and Kylo was a plodding mess that took me out of the film to look at my watch. The colloquial expressions of the Storm Troopers, also took me out of the film. If you turn of your cynicism off, there are some good pieces.  I think it was better than Last Jedi from tone to the ""humor."" But, if you think about what is going on, you realize that the story doesn't really make much sense.   I felt that they were jamming as much as possible into the film to just wrap it up,   The redemption of Kylo Ren/Ben Solo was the strongest part of the film -- the rest was just loud noises.",2.0

9901,Tim,"Dec 30, 2019","Like Episodes 7 & 8, Episode 9 was an absolute catastrophe in screenwriting and filmmaking. Abrams tries to pack so much action into the movie that you dont realize that the story is poorly written and riddled with plot holes. The characters are the same bland, vacuous personalities that no one cares about, although there is some attempt at something resembling character development. One of the worst things that this film and trilogy does is ignore the rules and parameters of the universe in which they are operating. Making up or changing rules from previously established material is the ultimate characteristic of bad storytelling, showing either a laziness to review the source material or a blatant disregard for the source material. Disney seems to think that they can just keep pumping out crappy films and slapping the Star Wars name on them while putting in minimal effort so that they can make as much money as possible. I, for one, disregard completely 7, 8, & 9. Theyre not Star Wars films theyre an easy cash grab for a corporation that has zero creativity or respect for the Star Wars universe. Congratulations Disney Star Wars, you will be remembered as an embarrassing failure — the product of a greedy & lazy company run by a bunch of cinematic hacks.",1.0

9987,Dwayne,"Dec 30, 2019","For Stars Wars fans this is a necessary movie to help close out some previous story lines.

9989,A Great Ending to the Whole Saga!!,"Dec 30, 2019","What I liked about it is that between the other two previously released movies in this particular series of Star Wars is that it is able to stand on it's own apart from the others.  It helps that you know the story and background from the previous two movies, but it definitely can definitely be seen on it's own and you know what's going on.  It was awesome, I loved it, and will see it again (I'll own this once it comes out for sale).",5.0
9990,Geppert,"Dec 30, 2019","I was really surprised at how much I loved this movie. I really likes Force Awakens and Last Jedi but didn't love them as much IV - VI and Rogue One. This one was different and thought it was an awesome way to ""wrap up"" the Skywalker story.",5.0

What a great Star Wars movie, in the top 3 for sure, right after Return of the Jedi as number one, of course, then Revenge of the Sith a close second and now Rise of Skywalker coming in at 3.
All of the answers you wanted are in this movie, a great conclusion to our 42 year journey!

10039,Ed W,"Dec 30, 2019","So sad to see the entire last trilogy be so awful with so many opportunities to be the best. George Lucas should have never sold it and finished it himself. Luke Skywalker is the main character and the entire story arc, episodes 1 through 9 should have focused on that and mostly did until this last trilogy. This story was Luke Skywalkers heros journey and should have stayed that way and concluded with that. Rey couldve easily been an apprentice given the Force Awakens and the linkage to Lukes lightsaber. After this last trilogy, Disney could have easily done another three movies focusing on Reys journey after Luke finished his in an epic battle after episode 9. Lack of imagination, story-telling ability, and foresight really hurt this last installment and there is no satisfaction knowing this is the last Star Wars we will see with Luke Skywalker. Its a real slap in the face of everyone who has followed these movies and read Lucas novel to end like this. The director and writers of Rogue One would have done a better job than Abrams or Johnson.",0.5

10053,Charles B,"Dec 30, 2019","JJ Abrams ruined the Star Wars story and left the door open for another trilogy by not explaining Rey's family tree.  Her parents are described as nobodies even though her father is the son of Palpatine? (Palpatine never had a kid in any previous movie)  And isnt her mother an important piece? So...her nobody parents ie children of Palpatine had to hide Rey?  Why?  Because Palpatine is alive and wants her dead?  Then in the end, Rey becomes a Skywalker simply by calling herself one?  Terrible story telling.

He ruins the Return of the Jedi by bringing Palpatine back to life when George Lucas clearly had him die with no intentions to bring him back.  And he ruined this trilogy with the horrible family tree story of Rey. (whos mother is still a nobody BTW)

Positives: still the visuals were good and fun to watch, and we love how you brought back Lando and all of the originals.

Missed opportunity but atleast we have more Star Wars movies...",3.0

Midichlorians, Greedo shooting first, bad green screen prequels, Jar Jar, kiddie level sequences, life resurrecting force powers, etc. I am glad that Snopes was explained as well as Leia's Jedi training.

And, for me at least, it seems that the ending continues to leave the back-gate open for perhaps yet another fantastic generation.  We can hope!!!",5.0
10131,DELETED USER,"Dec 30, 2019","The movie is over bloated, rushed, and gives no time for any character or plot developments to breathe. The major plot points (the big bad and main character reveal) are laughably silly. Feels like whoever made this movie didn't watch episode 7 or 8. Feels like a fanfic (not a good thing).",0.5

10154,DELETED USER,"Dec 30, 2019","A sad end to a space epic. The only good things I can say about it is that C3PO had some genuinely funny moments and there are some truly spectacular moments and set pieces. The unfortunate thing is that the talents of the actors were wasted on the awful writing which left plot holes large enough to fly a Death Star through. 
In short, if you want a mindless action film this is fine. As a Starwars film, this is a sad end to what was once a modern epic.",1.5

The script kept my mind on the screen the entire duration of the film.  Why did I even waste my time watching all the spoilers on YouTube?  All the YouTubers out there know who you are that try to ruin it for the audience.  I’ll rate this film of the recent trilogy as my favorite.  Is it my favorite Star Wars overall?  Absolutely not!!!

10204,J Thomas,"Dec 30, 2019",This was definitely the weakest of the Disney era Star Wars movies.  I feel like they had great ideas but did a poor job executing the vision.  There was to many things that were too convenient to the plot with no real explanation.  In addition it suffered in part with what plagued the prequels of too much eye candy and spectacle and not enough exposition.  All in all I feel like they were going for and “End Game” type finale but they didn’t build up the credibility with the audience to earn that.  Still this trilogy as a whole was obviously better than the prequels even if the last installment felt a bit flat. That’s not to say it didn’t have its bright spots as the visuals and lightsaber duels were great. All in all I would recommend it because it is a Star Wars movies and they are an experience but there’s no need to rush.,2.5

10350,Colin,"Dec 31, 2019","It’s a good Star Wars installment in my opinion. I’ve been a star wars fan since the release of the prequels, so I guess I’m not as a genuine of a fan as those who loved the originals. This film is decent in content and makes for a great popcorn movie (one that’s not overly intellectual and mostly just has action scenes that are strictly entertaining) I however don’t like how this trilogy totally spat on the original trilogy. Basically w/o spoiling the film, Rise of Skywalker negates almost all occurrences of the originals and demeans many of beloved characters’ deaths. I also don’t like how fast it was. Surprisingly, for such a long movie, it went TOO DANG FAST! So many different plot lines, occurrences and new problems with immediate solutions, it’s crazy! Rian & JJ could have clearly cut out many time fillers, to give us a more concise film. But they didn’t and that’s unfortunate. The writing was also a little weak as many things happens that were totally unexplained and just made no sense. I’m trying not to spoil the film as I would love to go into the details. If you’ve seen it, you should know what I’m talking about. The humor is much more tame than the Last Jedi (who’s humor I found to be too frequent and too cheap). Still a good Star Wars film, just don’t look too deep into it. Special effects are great as usual, but even a turd can be wrapped in gold.",3.5

It is action packed, interesting, and has a clear story arc. If one were to overanalyze and dissect every scene, you could find fault with anything.

There's so much going, so many characters, so many locations, planets, battles, new romantic interests, jokes and surprises that it almost puts this film in a class by itself. Is it worth watching? Definitely yes if you follow the Star Wars franchise. It's also worth watching just to see how film-making has evolved. And if you have any interest in the characters of Kylo Ren, Princess (General) Leia Organa and Rey you will not want to miss this final installment in the nine-part Skywalker saga. It's a long flick, coming in at 2 hours, 22 minutes. The PG-13 rating belies the fact that you will see many, many deaths. However the killings are sanitized so you are spared any blood and gore. Many are stylized deaths that are clever and inventive. The storm trooper are rather dehumanized in this respect, seeming more like props than people. But do go see it and behold 21st century mythology at its finest.",5.0
10395,Archivist,"Dec 31, 2019","A fast-paced, entertaining flick with all the excitement and flair one would expect of a Star Wars movie. Unfortunately, in this final movie of the trilogy, it is apparent that little care was taken to make the three films mesh in a cohesive manner, and TROS suffers for it. Additionally, the ending, though suitably dramatic and flashy, seemed quite lazy and decidedly lacking in creativity.

10415,Amotkram,"Dec 31, 2019","Entertaining but full of plot holes. I try to stay non-spoiler here but be careful...

Kiss was completely out of context. The relationship was in no way built for romance. That was a classic Disney climax feel good moment misplaced. 
The diabolical mastermind that has plotted for eternity, and apparently plotted past death, was plotting on giving it all up even though everything before was all about wanting it all for himself. His demise was his inability to foresee the obvious connection that everyone but him saw. 
Basically Disney's writers have no idea how to come up with something new so they rehash everything from the originals. 
Also no care that the scenes are completely unrealistic. Riding horseback on the outside of a stay destroyer? One over several ridiculously unrealistic parts of the movie. 
""Wait there is something I must tell you before we die... What were you going to tell me. Never mind, I'll tell you later. Never mentioned again."" Why the editors didn't see that and trim it out. Poor editing with stuff like that all over the place. 
Why only Luc and Leia on spirit form at the end. What about the one the was saved and turned to the good side next to his kin. Oops, we messed that up too. 
Why call the movie Rise of Skywalker if in the end there is no Skywalker? Well we can fix that by a cheesy sloppy close that loophole scene.

Music was as always great although no new themes of development of the existing themes. Would love, for the directors and powers to be, to commission Williams to create all new everything soundtrack. I am sure Williams is up to the task. He never disappoints.
Instead, like everything from all big scene production tycoons, go with the proven formula. Who cares that we are killing the formula with gross overuse.",3.0

It had action, symbolism and connection with the past while exploring the relationship with the new band of rebels. There is not one thing that I would change. I’ll admit I was apprehensive about seeing it after the slow motion chase (and ultimate crash both literally and figuratively) of The Last Jedi. JJ Abrams and writers hit the ball out of the park with this movie - so much so that the ending left me wanting more from the new band of rebels.

I watched it in 3d IMAX and it really didn't help much. I personally think I should have waited for TV. My best analogy would be it is like a star trek episode were you know all the red shirts are gonna die and the rest make it till the end or almost.,3.0

10463,DELETED USER,"Dec 31, 2019","This review is just one persons opinion of The Rise of Skywalker  so take it for just that.   There are spoilers in here too.  I will never follow critic reviews ever again because they really just don't get it...in my opinion.  The critics gave The Last Jedi rave reviews...the movie that almost destroyed the series, turned the beloved hero, Luke Skywalker into a coward, had the most bizarre scene of Leah flying through outer space, and showed us a disturbing sight of Luke milking some giant walrus creature.  I will spare you and let that be the end of dredging up that disaster of a Star Wars movie.  And then they gave The Rise of Skywalker bad reviews.  Please don't listen to movie critics if you truly have an open mind and are a true die hard Star Wars lover like me.  I saw Star Wars A New Hope in the theatre when it first opened in the 70s and every Star Wars movie since in the theatre.  Have loved every one of them to varying degrees.  I've got my favorites of course.  
I was skeptical after The Last Jedi  movie because I really did not have much hope that the series could be saved.  But some how, JJ Abrams, Disney, Lucasfilm created an amazing Star Wars movie that pulled everything together in a way that made sense.  I heard some say they would not have brought the Emperor back... but in this case I have to disagree.  There was no other way this could go.   A truly bad villain makes a movie better...and there was never any other baddie as bad as the Emperor.  And to have the grandson of Skywalker and the grand daughter of the Emperor face off against him was poetic and brilliant.  Totally didn't see it coming and for that, I loved it.   This movie answered our questions and tied up loose ends in a way that I could accept.   Okay so maybe this movie was satisfying and gave the fans what they wanted.  But who buys the movie tickets and Blu-ray Discs? A big thank you to JJ Abrams and Disney and all the wonderful talented actors who so brilliantly brought life to their characters and for giving us a wonderful ending to our beloved Star Wars series.

10467,Madsieb,"Dec 31, 2019","I liked that it was Star Wars, I disliked the sporadic additions to the story and nonsensical characters that had to show up.  Finn was basically useless throughout the story, his biggest line was just saying Reys name non stop and Rey is still a lackluster lead.  Could have been great, but certain directorial choices didn’t hit the mark.",3.0
10468,Tiffany G,"Dec 31, 2019","As a Gen X-er who grew up with these movies, I was excited for this final trilogy.  Episode 7 was very good and delivered on all the things our generation wanted to see.  Things took a turn with Episode 8, which was pretty meandering.  Episode 9 was slightly better, but too long and too predictable.  There were a few moments when I smiled or had a little chuckle, and it was nice to have Lando back. Overall though, I didn't feel invested in the characters and wasn't even sad about the ones who didn't make it.  Maybe the expectations for this film were impossibly high -- folks my age have waited more than 40 years for this movie.  Who knows if anything would've been good enough, but it felt like a meager effort from the writing/directing team.  It was visually impressive, but longtime fans know that is not what was compelling about the story.  Fare thee well, original cast, I wish your departure had been dealt with in a more befitting manner.",3.0

Better be one or the other or there are going to be some very disappointed fans. The special effects were awesome and the performances were unforgettable Including Carrie Fisher's. It was a very nice surprise to see that her role was so large in this episode. They either filmed all of her scenes before she died, or they CGI'd them very well.",4.0

I was pleased as could be that we had many more opportunities to see Carrie Fisher in this episode, but equally as pleased to see that Harrison Ford was in it, as well as Mark Hamill, and Billy Dee Williams.  I do feel another Star Wars in the making with John Boyega's character having so many ""feelings""...and that the new young female who helped him conquer the enemy ship will be telling her story!

JJ Abrams doesn't disappoint, and now we can go ANYWHERE in the Star Wars universe WITHOUT needing a Skywalker or the Jedi to act as glue. I sincerely appreciated their NOT recasting Leia / Carrie Fisher's role, but weaving in additional footage to keep the faith.

Glad it allowed some characters and actors to again reprise and likely conclude nostalgic roles, albeit posthumously. Little novel and much good is just a copy of an original, if not simple, story decades or millennia old, in some new packaging and with Disney still blatantly, and not so blatantly, copying what worked in old Star Wars movies. Then there are times when it feels like someone is trying too hard to play to the now and make up for certain stereotypes, or in the case of Disney, maybe to continue to over-balance its past male and hetero chauvinism.",2.0

10747,Matthew,"Dec 31, 2019","Very rushed. Interactions between Poe, Finn and Rey felt thrown in, with very few memorable moments, let alone interesting in any capacity. Felt very crammed, especially Poe's new backstory. New characters like Zorri are not interesting and don't have enough screen time to be memorable. Palpatines return ruins Anakin's redemption in ROTJ. No scene ever stays still long enough to let it resonate emotionally or plot-wise. Awful film, and a disgrace to the saga and movies in general. Don't worry Star Wars, JJ can't hurt you anymore.",1.5

She always looked like she wanted to say something but either couldn't remember or was told not to.  Rey was always on the brink of an emotional breakdown, even when just having conversation. The plot line was ok but left holes. For instance, why couldn't Rey just stand her ground and challenge Palpatine the first time? What was the difference? Either way she was fighting for the Jedi so what changed.  Movie was slow in some parts and skipped around too much in others.  The original movies were better IMHO and had more depth of character that was acted out, not just monologued.  I'm still trying to figure out how Rey flew in a fighter jet that had been submerged for years and didn't get out dripping wet.  Must have had a powerful hairdryer.",3.0

The final skywalker film.  And it is beautiful.  in every single moment of the film, you feel as if you're dancing with fate like Rey, you're battling your emotions like Ben, and you are trying to not mess it all up like Finn.  This movie was made for us, THE FANS.  it was made by a man who appreciates star wars because he is a fan first, director/producer second.  Watching this on the 19th was transcendent.  I truly hope it is for you.  And if you are reading this...may the force be with you.",5.0
10870,Austin,"Dec 31, 2019","Movie would be really great if you are not a huge Star Wars fan. I enjoyed the movie for what it is but it was not a great ending to a 9 film saga.

It wasn't a master piece but I really did end up enjoying it. I didn't leave in disgust, I didn't want my money back. The story is nothing new, but all the actors benefit from a better script. Fight scenes and space battles are exciting and I was not distracted by any obvious miss cuts or timing issues. I really liked how they handled certain characters with respect. I don't know if its just because of the previous one, but the fan service was very welcomed. Talking about other things happening in the universe and including a few things that made parts of the previous extended universe cannon. Over all it was worth the price of admission.",4.0

I would say I place it firmly in the 5th best movie in the series behind the original series and revenge of the sith.  I’d have it tied with or slightly better than clone wars.  It’s a great movie that won’t disappoint the hard core fan.  I grew up with the original series as I was 7 when the original came out in 1977.",4.0

But the single most egregious, and offensive, act committed by the director - is allowing the last sentence spoken in the movie - to be a lie, which is an offense that a Jedi would never be part of - for it is an insidious reminder of the character's true heritage.",2.0

10911,DELETED USER,"Dec 31, 2019","Sloppy storytelling and so many more questions left than answers.  No resolution to any of the characters for the exception of Leia and Ben Solo.  No resolution for Finn or Poe or any other of the trilogy characters.  What was that bit of oddness with Lando at the end?  Fans keep pointing to the scene with Palpatine/Anakin from Episode III where he describes how Darth Plageuis was able to conqueror death yet, how did the Emperor survive the fall in ROTJ and also the second Death Star explosion?  Why Exegol?  I could create a long list of questions why certain characters remain unresolved.  What happened to Ahsoka Tano or Ezra Bridger?  Why not a quick cameo with Thrawn commanding the Imperial fleet?  

Why wasn't this film broken up in two parts, slow down the pacing and actually tell the story instead of this fast & furious, John Wick fast-moving stance from literally the beginning of the film to the bizarre end.  And was that a reshot of Rey from Passana redone for the last shot?  Makes me wonder if there was another ending and I'd like to see what ended up on the cutting room floor that may have made this final outing more complete of a story.",0.5

10940,DELETED USER,"Dec 31, 2019","(Spoiler alert) For the ending of the Star Wars movies, it really makes you ask questions. There are still things that need to be talked about that were not fully explained. Like why did they show the big first order ships crashing into different planets if they weren't going to do something with it. I was surprised that the sith lord palpatine was Ray's grandfather. I was also surprised that Leia had a son and her son was Kylo Ren. I was so sad when I saw that Leia was dying. I was also surprised to know that Han and Leia were married.I liked how she had to use the force in order to make Kylo Ren join the Jedi. She had to die though just to reach out to him. I was also very surprised that all of the past Jedi helped Rey to get up off the ground to fight.",4.5

10948,DELETED USER,"Dec 31, 2019","As a life-long fan of Star Wars I wanted to love this movie, but ultimately it broke my heart. I just couldn't get past the numerous issues present in this movie, including: 

- Characters of color were depicted with negative racial stereotypes. 
- Characters present in the last two movies were reduced to bit parts in favor of new characters or characters played by friends of JJ Abrams. 
- All the named female characters from TFA and TLJ were reduced to bit parts. 
- Few characters were given character arcs, and beloved characters were reduced to plot devices for other characters. 
- Characters depictions were both misogynistic and misandryist.
- The plot was rushed to the point of being nonsensical. The movie was so jam-packed it was impossible to process anything before the next three things had happened. 
- The numerous plot holes distracted from the main story and contributed to the nonsensical plot. 
- The movie came off as if someone made a checklist of every complaint made by Reddit and Twitter, tried to fix them, and then filled in the plot around those fixes. 
- JJ Abrams claimed the movie had LGBT+ representation, which turned out to be a 2 second kiss that was easily glossed over. 
- Fanservice moments are forced into the plot in ways that neither advance the plot nor make sense. 

Overall it feels as if Abrams and Terrio were too busy fitting in new characters, planets, and fanservice moments to remember to write a story that makes sense for the characters they already have. While there are moments that are individually satisfying the end result is a wholly unsatisfying and disappointing end to the Skywalker saga.",0.5

I’ve seen the entire prequel trilogy since Phantom Menace first came out and by far this trilogy is WAY better.  Nothing can compete with the Original Trilogy, but I’m not reviewing to hate on the prequels too or knit pick on this movie’s choices. My feelings toward the entire new Trilogy is more positive, because of it’s originality. Enough of that Mary Sue crap because Rey proves she is both an inspiring character and human. I won’t spoil anything that the trailers probably did already but for those who really watched the movie you’ll understand how much effort was put into the story and special effects, without worrying about how it picks up after Last Jedi, or worrying what you thought was going to happen. What happens today is that most people anticipate way too much making they’re own story in their minds. And if it’s not on screen then they get upset easily. Just like Dark Knight Rises after The Dark Knight wowed, you can’t have over expectations but faith in your feelings watching this. I loved it and personally think the cast were a blast!",5.0

They forcefully shoved about 3.5 hours of content into less than 2.5 hours of movie - resulting in chaos, which led to disappointment, and then anger. My poor attempt at Star Wars puns aside, haha, this was probably the least original, most unbelievable, downright ridiculous Star Wars movie yet. Even worse than Phantom or Attack of the Clones. Ugh, what a disaster. Two stars because Daisy Ridley somehow figured out how to deliver another solid performance, but the other actors were so-so, hamstrung by time constraints. About the near exclusion of Tran's character - how could they have possibly carved out time for an extraneous supporting cast? They would have had to remove Billy Dee's reprisal as Lando, which in itself was unnecessary. Ugh. Thank goodness for Rogue One and Mandalorian - this Disney thing led by Kathleen Kennedy is a travesty for anyone who knows better. Geez. I hope they don't screw up the X-Men.",2.0

11251,Dan,"Jan 01, 2020",The only reason that it wasn't a 1 star was because the visual effects were great. At least someone knew how to do their job right. The acting was completely sub-par. Finn and Poe were trying to channel the slap-stick comedy that makes Marvel great but it all falls flat because this isn't the MCU. The dialogue seems forced. The lightsaber scenes were horribly executed. If you took away the elegant graceful lightsabers and replaced them with medical axes or swords it would've fit better. I thought all of the Force Skyping was hilarious. Especially during one of Rey's Force Skype calls she gives Kylo (or Ben idk who he is at this point) a lightsaber. This movie is far better to watch wasted as a comedic parody movie of Star Wars than as part of the original Star Wars Universe. Hopefully this is the last big screen Star Wars movie that Disney tries to butcher because they obviously can't get it right. Perhaps they need to stick to Disney+ Star Wars until they can figure out how to make a Star Wars movie script.,2.0

This stated, I think JJ did a remarkable job salvaging the franchise as best as possible owing to the treatment in Last Jedi. Kennedy/Johnson may claim Last Jedi was only playing 'red herrings', but the previous film certainly didn't read that way. Some jeopardy/action scenes didn't appear to serve much purpose, but the surprise power sets do fit with some lore from the expanded universe. This stated, there is deus ex machina that goes unexplained, and isn't merely suspension of disbelief - but flies in the face of object permanence in the SW universe, so whatever.",3.0

That's what happens when a monstrous corporate overlord with a political agenda takes over a series. The movie is frustratingly obvious, unsurprising and uncreative. The attempts at nostalgia are weak at best and as an audience member you can tell it's there only to try to pander to original fans. Any attempt at cohesive story telling and honoring original cast was done away with in the previous two movies. It's also sad to see that the leaks for the movie were spot on accurate. The only redeeming grace were the star battles and fight scenes. Oh.. and Rey is still a Mary Sue character. Awful planning; or lack of it, in this finale trilogy.

It’s better than all 3 prequels. There are issues like some conveniences they make to end the story. But I especially enjoyed Daisy Ridleys portrayal of Rey. One thing I didn’t like was the look of the climactic space battle. The Light Saber duel earlier in the film with Kylo and Rey was the best part. Overall I can see if people have issues with the film but I enjoyed it.,4.0

11325,Damon,"Jan 01, 2020","Most of the rise of Skywalker's problems come from the fact that it spent a large portion of its run time retconning the last jedi. This movie feels completely disjointed from the last 2 movies in this trilogy because it had to be. I personally think J J Abrams did the best he could with what he was given, especially considering how little time he had to put this together. That doesnt excuse this movie, but it does help to soften the blow. Had this trilogy been planned out from the beginning, then both episodes 8 and 9 would have been better off. At the end of the day, this movie has too much shoved into, it is the most fast passed exposition dump I have ever watched. None of the twists or surprises have any impact because of how fast this movie rushes you to the next scene. There is never a break of any kind so you can attempt to digest and react to what you've just seen. This movie is better than the last jedi, in my opinion, but that's not saying much, so I'll just say, you can at least have fun with this movie. Unless you're a fan of the last jedi then you will absolutely despise this movie.",2.5

This movie was possibly the worst Star Wars movie I’ve seen, just beneath Solo and Phantom Menace. I think it had two main problems (among others): it didn’t have heart (very little in the way of camaraderie/friendship/family bickering/playful teasing that I loved from the original trilogy and that they mostly kept in the last two movies), and it had too many moments that felt non-Star Wars (call me a Star Wars purist, because I strongly disliked the movie’s opening 5 minutes that sets the stage for the whole film, plus many other little moments that introduced seemingly new powers and dynamics never seen in a Star Wars film before). It largely felt like it lacked joy and thrill, which Star Wars films usually have in spades. Kind of a bummer. I was so looking forward to seeing this film. You should still see it (if you love Star Wars like me), but there’s a good chance it will disappoint you.",1.5

It just felt more like a real Star Wars, and it did tie up a lot of loose plot holes from that last film, and delivered a better and even a little unexpected story line.  Though I did feel there were some loose ends with this film, it had a much more cohesive story.  Kudos JJ, you saved the classic epic!  I would recommend this.",4.0

That aside, the real value Star Wars is in the theatrical experience that Lucasfilm faithfully delivers—the sets, costumes, special effects and sound are all top notch.

It was entertaining, beautiful, and a little messy. However, I can't really fault this movie for the story problems created by the previous film.

As usual the theater had the volume cranked up loud enough to crack the pavement in the parking lot.

These stories are still about hope, the power of choices, and moral clarity. It took a second viewing of ROS for me to really enjoy it, but once I let go of what I know of Star Wars canon and what I hoped/expected in a finale, I was able to enjoy the fun ride, spectacular action, and truly great performances from Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. There are plot conveniences for sure, but if you remove your critic hat you can have a lot of fun with this movie.",3.5

When Vader walked into the first movie, you thought, “Holy $”@& he is a seriously scary dude” - no special effects or anything, just presence, you held your breath.

Truthfully this should have been split into two movies, but then we'd hear even more about how Disney is only interested in maximizing profits. 
Spoilers ahead Did they cut Rose pretty much out of the story? Sure. Did they introduce two new characters (which we'll likely see in future movies) that had no backstory and were barely in the film? Sure. Did they force (pun intended) our heroine to choose between good and evil? Did they bring back and old villain and reurn a villain to the light? That's what makes for a great Star Wars movie.",5.0

Totally missed great opportunities to have some real character development but dialog was trite and repetitive.  I also felt it was weird that there was so much celebration at the end with no  acknowledgement for the people that died.  One  star for having moments I thought were going to break through and fizzled out and one star for  some good action scenes.  I was bored through most of the movie.,2.0

11773,SMA,"Jan 01, 2020","They worked out an ending to a convoluted storyline from, especially, the previous two films. Plot tension overall was lacking, although there were moments. John Williams and orchestra superbly tied musical themes from the nine films. Original actors contributed, newer ones put memorable life into their own characters. Overall, the crucial issues and conflict, Jedi and Sith, light and dark, empire and republic remain in an muddle, which was perhaps intended. There was some humor, but the fun and youthful zest of the late seventies shows were lost in grim confusion. Still, it’s a landmark ending, much enhanced by Dolby Cinema. THX, Skywalker Sound, ILM, et al have created new opportunities, but as Pixar has shown, the story, acting and cinematic achievements remain key requirements, too.  Worth seeing.",3.5

11827,George,"Jan 01, 2020","Maybe anything was bound to be a disappointment after The Last Jedi, but the storyline felt at times like it was simultaneously rushing to tie itself to the saga's history and to come to closure, particularly often in the first half hour or so - and, expectedly, both ended up feeling forced. The movie was best when it was itself, even if that was done just as a riff on its own labored attempts at historical parallel, such as when the ""big reveal"" painfully cribbed from Empire gets an interjection from a key character near the end of the scene, or when the equally painfully cribbed could-have-been-Endor plan to win the last battle took an unexpected twist or two. Still hard not to enjoy the final Star Wars tale - but it would've been nice if the end of the canonical space saga would have been just a little less derivative and a bit more revelatory in its aim.",3.5

I’ll definitely be seeing this again. The film is gorgeous visually and does well in the close quarters scenes as well stirring plenty of proper drama and emotion. I’m not sure that critics whom would rate a Marcel movie 80+ % have any right to suggest this is mediocre in comparison, which seems to be the case.

The special effects couldn’t save the film as that lacked which shouldn’t have happened considering how much Lucas Films has the expenses.

Luckily, I only spent $2 and some cents (thanks to a coupon) so I’m good.",3.0

The emotionally charged relationships, the humor, the special effects that went beyond awesome to be exquisitely beautiful, the call backs. I am okay that some were awkward or a stretch because this is also a theme. These are not your finely groomed Hollywood heroes - they are awkward, goofy and relatable people. The final scene was such a powerful replay of one of the most transfixing things I saw, unexpectedly, on screen, more than 40 years ago. The power of it lies in its quiet simplicity. It has been an image in my mind, for more than 40 years, of purpose, meaning, dedication and commitment, and loneliness, in a galaxy far, far away.",5.0

It also shed some light on just how dark the dark side actually is. It's just my opinion, of course, but I would recommend this film to anyone who may be feeling hesitant about ending the Skywalker storyline.

12240,Donald,"Jan 02, 2020","Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was an epic way to end the Skywalker Saga. It was a cinematic experience of epic proportions and there was some twists I really didn't see. The only negative things I can think of is that they should have led on Emperor Palpatine pulling all the strings earlier in the trilogy than they did. They could've done more things with Finn. I think it would've been an interesting concept of a rogue stormtrooper escaping the First Order and actually finds out that he has a deep connection with the force which enables him to commence his transformation into a jedi throughout the trilogy and before facing Palpatine he confronts his old commander Captain Phasma with all the knowledge he has gained. He ultimately ends up beating her, but instead of killing her he spares her and we find out that Captain Phasma was actually his sibling that he never found out about and then Palpatine does his famous line of ""UNLIMITED POWER"" as he absorbs her life force like with what he does with Rey and Ben at the end of the movie. He then grows gigantic and can breathe lightning and just grabs Phasma with his gigantic hands and rips her head off right in front of Finn. Finn is mad, but can't do anything about it as he sticks a kyber crystal into Phasma's lifeless headless body and uses it as a lightsaber. That would've been so cool. But what we got was still an amazing way to end the saga and the biggest space battle in the entire series with the stakes being so much higher than in any of the movies that came before. I have to say though that Palpatine exploding in Return of the Jedi is so much tamer than the disintegration that happens to him at the end of this movie. That was such a violent death. It was also amazing to see how powerful he gets after absorbing Rey and Ben's lifeforces and brings a whole new meaning to unlimited power. It was also pretty cool to find out that Snoke was just a clone made by Palpatine and that every sith lives in him so when he dies they all die. It was an amazing movie and I was genuinely surprised especially with the Han Solo cameo and the amazing violent death of Emperor Palpatine. 10/10",5.0

At least it wasn't painfully dull and slow like the Prequels, but that ain't saying much. At least we can all finally put the series to rest and feel free to be disappointed with other Disney products now. That's a silver lining, right?",1.0

True, much more could’ve been done, but the main key element for this film (Carrie Fisher), had passed so there were only so many avenues available to wrap this story and pay homage to Leia Organa simultaneously. I applaud JJ Abrams for his delicate handling of this unplanned for tragedy. Ultimately, (IMO), the true story of this saga was always about faith and hope for a better tomorrow against all odds, and that’s exactly what I felt after the end of this film.",4.0

But then story content just carried me away from myself into a maelstrom feeling states that left intoxicated.  The bare bones plot was eclipsed by the densely packed symbolic story content.  It is actually literature disguised as entertainment.

We thought it was as good as the original,  Episodes 4, 5 and 6.  I laughed,I  cried happy tears, and in between I was on the edge of my seat.  The only negative is how they portrayed Palpatin.  Having him hooked up to that ... well to that whatever it was ... was the only time I had to stretch my imagination.  This is still a 5-star movie.  How can it not be with a cameo by the Ewoks!

12453,PT,"Jan 02, 2020","Don't listen to the fanboys on YouTube, the haters or the critics... This movie was incredible, and could not have been done much better. With so much to sew up (overall) and so much to undo (The Last Jedi), the filmmakers had a tremendous burden to bear. I feel that the finished product they developed worked on multiple levels and SHOULD appeal to the masses. It had equal parts action, humor, team building, back story and conflict resolution. The pacing has certainly come under scrutiny from critics all I can say is I was never bored and the 2.5 hours flew by. The movie looked gorgeous on the big screen, and it had some of the best fight scenes and dialogue of the entire series. I'm 44 and Star Wars has always been a big part of my life, so I honestly did not know what to expect from this film. Final verdict: I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it immensely. I know I'm in the minority on this, but I highly recommend Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker for anyone. Give it a chance, go in with an open mind, and you might just find yourself thoroughly entertained. 5 stars!",5.0

12523,DELETED USER,"Jan 02, 2020","I really enjoyed The Rise of Skywalker. (I will list out some my specific pros and cons at the end, which will include some SPOILERS... but i will fairwarn before getting there.)

I was 7 years old when I saw and fell in love with the original Star Wars movie (episode 4), and each of these new Star Wars movies has brought me back to that 7-year old, wide-eyed and in awe self that helped shape who I am today. Now, I get to share a piece of my childhood with my kids.

I was most interested to see how JJ Abrams was going to handle Leia and Carrie Fisher's passing, and while it was obvious (to an adult) the scenes were pieced together and the actors and director worked around what they had, i felt they did a good job. My daughter (7) and son (4.5) had no idea and loved it.


Some my specific pros and cons below, which does include some SPOILERS:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pros:
- Great action scenes
- Fun character dialog
- Nice twist in finding out Rey's true lineage
- Adam Driver's acting performance
- Babu Frik is awesome
- More world building, and introducing new moons/planets like Kijimi, Pasaana, Kef Bir, and Exogol. 
- Taps into the Legends novels, bringing some characters and concepts back into canon.
- An homage to Raiders of the Lost ark when the First Order transporter is blown up on Pasaana
- The tribute it pays to Carrie Fisher
- New looks into the powers of the force including transferring physical items through time and space, and healing.)
- Social progress - There's a brief, onscreen LGBT celebratory kiss

Neutrals
- Movie length. I personally didn't mind the 2:35 length, and was attentive the whole time. It allowed the film to breath more into the story, though I'm sure they could've dropped some scenes (e.g., bits on Kijimi). But, those scenes can open up new directions for the franchise to explore in additional mediums.

Cons:
- Some small and confusing plot holes that are answered only after you read ""The visual dictionary of The Rise of Skywalker"".
- Some things left on the table, specifically what did did Finn want to say to Rey? It was left unresolved. My theory is that he wanted to tell her he was force sensitive. 
- Referencing Palpatine's survival as something to with cloning, and how the Sith were into that. This is a brush off in my opinion. 
- The Dead Speaks! Reading this as the first line of the scroll made me raise an eyebrow. Introducing Palpatine in this way seemed odd. My hope is they will show ""Palpatine's message"" at some point in Star Wars Resistance, or some other media.",4.5

It's clear that there were some early conflicts within LucasFilm and there was a LOT of studio interference at the Disney level, but I hope they understand that audiences want BETTER STAR WARS MOVIES.

While the hardcore and the ""critics"" may not like the ""easy answers"" and loose ends, most of us continue to enjoy the unparalleled effects and action and the timeless stories of the Star Wars universe.  I understand the massive task that JJ Abrams had in trying to tie the previous 8 movies together and provide all of the answers for a sprawling saga and, all things considered, he and his team managed this herculean task reasonably well. I am comfortable with the permanent additions to the character list as well and REALLY enjoyed the return of some of the greats!

Sadly the rest of the movie didn't recover, although it did try its best.  Graphically, it's Starwars on a big screen, amazing eye candy as always.  Sadly the first third was so bad to me, I had a hard time letting go and getting immersed in the story.  This one fell below phantom menace for me.",2.5

I don't think it is ret-con(ing?) at all, in fact, I spent much of the last two years (until I had to stop because I couldn't take the negativity from the loudest of the haters) trying to explain how I felt that they planned all of this more than they let on, and how it was all going to play out. It seemed clear to me, and I believe if you gave truth serum to JJ and Rian, they would probably tell you that they had a plan from the beginning (maybe Colin wasn't on board and that's why he had to go?). Regardless, if you love Star Wars and don't get your jollies from being a contrarian or at least insist on going into this film with a pessimistic attitude, then I think there is a pretty good chance that you will really love this movie. I know I did. I'm going to miss SW during this hiatus, and I hope the plan is to make a lot more movies and TV series very soon.",5.0

I loved the comedic moments (especially Finn, really great) and really loved the relationship development between Rey and Kylo Ren. I love KR's intensity, it really made the movie for me.

A very rushed film and the final battle was over so quickly... I don’t know why they could not make it better like the final battle in the revenge of sith...

12837,NOT My Star Wars,"Jan 03, 2020","Star Wars 9 (9 reasons why I hated it...)

1. DISNEY’S FORCE - All of a sudden the Force can teleport necklaces & Sith-trackers and anything that hits the floor while imagining you’re in the same room as someone across the galaxy Disney’s Force also allows ghost jedis to catch lightsabers but their new force does not allow teleporting across a violent sea current (hmm add zero consistency too) it allows to heal dead people and read people’s minds except your own suppressed memories that of being related to the most powerful Sith ever. The inconsistency of “Disney’s Force” is really the only consistency, and unbelievable fiction at best... I prefer believable consistent fiction with rules. I mean some of the worst fictional movies had more consistency: Jason & Michael Myers had more consistency within their fictional stories compared to how badly Disney has screwed-up my favorite childhood movie franchise. 
2. SITH WAYFINDER - Seriously?! Do bad guys in any movie ever leave a tracking device to find them? No because it’s stupid baseless-fiction. 
3. ENEMY/ALLIES - I counted at least 4 different times when characters went from enemies to immediate allies, by trusting each other within 1 spoken sentence. Maybe since Disney knew how badly Episode 8 was received by their diehard fans, then they rewrote Episode 9 on the fly. However, while doing so they tried shoving too much in, too quickly...there could have been 3 different movies made from this 1 very over-saturated / sometimes complicated storyline (I was able to follow it, but that’s only because I know more about these storylines than the average person, and apparently Disney too). 
4. RISE OF SKYWALKER - Ben Solo’s last name was Solo and Rey’s was Palpatine. So who actually rose as Skywalker??  I guess the writers ran out of time to explain clearly, but apparently Rey can just rename herself whatever she wants and just stole Luke’s last name at the very end...Keep in mind she is not related to Luke or “Leia Organa” at all and Ben was Luke’s nephew. So really the subtitle is as useless as this movie plot. 
5. LEIA A JEDI MASTER? - Besides Leia flying around in space in Ep-8 like Mary Popins (with no respirator) and the occasional “I can hear Luke calling me” moments from past movies. She has never been shown as a Jedi or ever had serious reference made to her being a Jedi until this movie as Rey’s “Jedi-Master”?! What another writing joke! I would’ve loved to have seen Leia develop as a Jedi in Ep-7. Yoda even eluded to that within Ep-6 which was the perfect set up for The Force Awakens (or even in Ep-8, Last Jedi) ...but “The Last Jedi” was Rey within Ep-8 so how could anyone remaining still be a Jedi unless Disney changed their minds because of all the backlash, and then rewrote 9? (Mystery solved)...Which they apparently did because with this new storyline written (Ep-9) now makes Ep-8 have “2 Last Jedis” left (Leia & Rey), not 1 “last jedi”...Like I said earlier this storyline was rushed / crammed into this new garbage movie, when it could have been built up within previous storylines or spread out as multiple movies. But missed opportunities from Disney’s failure in Episode 8 made them obviously u-turn in Ep-9 which is why everything but the kitchen sink was included into this terrible poorly written debacle of inconsistency.
6. ALL THE SITH IN ME - Come on! Palpatine comes back from the dead and has all the dead Sith Lords inside of him...Disney writing fail #100
7. ALL THE JEDI IN ME - Same as above but all the dead Jedi are inside Rey...Come on! Disney writing fail #101
8. THE LAST ORDER - A fleet of Star Destroyers are reborn from the ashes of an evil fairytale world, which no one can find (unless you have a handy dandy Sith Way-finder). This world seemingly has no resources or supplies but yeah there are mysteriously 100 times the fleet of the already huge First Order fleet. Totally makes sense Disney, and thanks for another of your over-exaggerated plot-lines because there apparently weren’t enough already over the top fiction ruler-breaker exaggerations within this pile of trash.
9. FORCE HEALING PROPERTIES - You clearly stole this from the recently written Baby Yoda character within the last aired episode (8) of the Mandalorian. Which only happened 2 days before Ep-9’s release date. PLEASE DO NOT ruin Yoda’s character too...John Favaro is a brilliant writer so I hope you’ll leave him in charge of The Mandalorian or I’ll have to jump off that ship soon too. I could go on but I’ve got a headache from these examples above. Bottom line...This is not my Star Wars, it’s Disney’s total pile of rule breaking fictional garbage!",0.5

12845,A fan,"Jan 03, 2020","I just wish, whom ever makes the decisions, they would not stray from what makes that reality real on its own. No bombers in space, no riding horse like creatures on the outside of flying spaceships, no ground troops on the same such....you never saw any of that even on Lucas’s dumb round.  Other than that it is a decent yet conservative take that has some great moments. Even if it rides on the successful formula of the original trilogy. At least Lucas was bold to try something twice. One great trilogy and one not so great. For someone who worked on two of the most fantastic science fiction film sagas. I wished he learned from the first one and had boldly gone where no one has gone before. This goes for you too Lucas film....",3.5

12961,ML,"Jan 03, 2020","I loved the movie, to be perfectly honest. It was a little difficult because of the whole Rian Johnson vs JJ Abrams rift in the force. Things didn't line up perfectly. JJ set us up perfectly with TFA, Rian came in and basically undid every plot point that JJ had set up during TLJ, and then JJ had to come back in and salvage his original plan with TROS. It definitely causes some problems, but I think he did a great job with what he was handed. Definitely a couple plot holes, but I find myself able to look past them where my husband cannot. He felt certain things were forced and should have been left alone. He felt a few things were made up for the sake of the plot that haven't been a part of the universe all along. He's not wrong, but personally I think they did a fair job explaining those things into being. Overall, I think they did a good job wrapping up the trilogy and cleaning up Rian's mess. It felt right to me.",4.0

Plenty of plot holes, questionable story choices, and open ends, but unless we want a 6 hour movie (or 2 parts like HP), this 2.5 hour movie does a good job of tackling that Herculean challenge. 

If you want more fan service, read the comics or the books.  Movies are for the masses and should be enjoyed as such.

13086,Michael S,"Jan 03, 2020","The Rise of Skywalker was a messy, fan-service conclusion to the Sequel Trilogy that tries too hard to evoke emotion.  Despite Disney declaring the Expanded Universe/Legends content non-canon, this movie borrowed heavily from it to tie up all the loose ends left over from poor story writing in Ep. 7 and 8.

The story takes place on 7 different planets in 125 minutes.  That's roughly 17 minutes at each location.  And due in part to covering all this ground this fast, the plot is razor thin most of the time.

Of course the effects, action scenes and score were superb.  And the acting was decent.  That's really what redeems it.  But the flow of the movie was lightning fast, and the movie suffered from it.  This really should have been 2 separate 2 hour films.

Walking out of the theater, I felt almost nothing.  Ultimately, it's just a popcorn munching forgettable film.  I'm just glad the sequel trilogy is over at this point.",2.5

I'm sad to see it end, sad that the characters that I cared about are no more.   I did enjoy the movie however.  The actors were wonderful and believable even if parts of the story seemed to stretch the powers of the Force a bit far.  I just remember that this is a movie and not real life.  It's an escape from the real world, where we're allowed and encouraged to believe in the basic and intrinsic ""goodness"" of our fellow beings.",4.0

13113,FH,"Jan 03, 2020",I have seen this movie before - it was called Revenge of the Sith / A new Hope / Empire Strikes Back / Return of the Jedi (mostly Return of the Jedi).  This movie broke many of the longstanding Star Wars rules like TIE fighters from episodes 4-6 were short range fighters without hyperdrives.  A Death Star that exploded into dust miraculously has large pieces in tact with windows and power.  JJ Abrams is notorious about borrowing ideas from other movies and even his TV shows.  The Rambaldi artifacts from Alias become the Wayfinder.  I was waiting to see if a ship crashed and the people in the tail section were marooned or overly-used lens flares around Rey.  The pace was too fast and solving problems was too easy.  The return of Palpatine just made little sense.  Better than VIII but still a mess.,1.5

I know many other folks have picked this movie apart, but let's be real in the fact that ""the force"" will never die (like this cash cow franchise) so they had to have just enough plot holes to be able to leave an opening for more side character movies, spin off shows, etc.

He fixed many of the gripes fans had with characters from the Last Jedi and gifted a fitting finish. I couldn’t have envisioned any other ending rather than this. Unfortunately this much damage control left him no choice but to introduce several, rather large plot devices that simply need to be accepted for the movie to digest well. Visuals were stunning, fight choreography was on par (although it’s nearly impossible for scenes to live up to Rey and Kylo taking out Snoke’s guards in TLJ), and the plot essentially moved from one point to another without any drag. All together it was an impressive conclusion to the Skywalker saga and as a lifelong Star Wars fan, I left the theater satisfied.",4.0

Main characters are killed off without explanation or development. Was Leia a jedi or not? Why was there no mention of this before? Whether the rebels win or lose is arbitrary and not believable. JJ seems like he's out to ""wow"" us, but like he really does not care about the story he's telling- and he's telling us not to care either. The Republic is destroyed, and the rebellion is just as easily and arbitrarily rebuilt. Rey is a noob, and she's a Jedi master overnight. Why not. JJ Abrams doesn't care. He leads us on with lots of skillful use of dramatic tools, but crumples his story up and tosses it in the trash. JJ, please care more about your art.",3.5

13233,square.wave,"Jan 03, 2020","This was certainly better than the other two films in the sequel trilogy, though the originals remain vastly superior.

Some may argue that there was a lot of fan service in this movie, but I think at this point a bit of fan service was needed. I get the impression that the role of the Emperor and the revelations about Rey's ancestry were late additions to the trilogy's story, and not conceived from the very beginning. I think there was some belated recognition that this trilogy needed to improve its connection to the lore of the originals, and bring back a legitimate antagonist. Since Episode VII my impression has been that the First Order is very much a Second Rate Empire.

I suppose they did as much as they could to clean up the mess of the previous film. My main gripe with this film is that the return of the Emperor takes away something from the culmination of the original trilogy -- Darth Vader's redemption arc and return to Anakin Skywalker.

The creative vision of George Lucas is missing from these new movies and it shows. It may be in a Galaxy Far, Far Away but it feels like a totally different Galaxy Far, Far Away.",3.5

Unless in the Clone Wars cartoon there is never any mention of Palpatine having any children in any movie or show until this movie. I feel like the resolution that was felt after Episode 6 can now never be felt again, Disney never addressed how Palpatine actually returns or if he can do it over and over again.

After the atrocity that was the Last Jedi and the very controversial trailer for the Rise of Skywalker, like having Palpatine come back for instance, I had no faith in this movie. I should have known that it would turn out alright, thanks to J.J. Abrams who came back to direct. He was able to take what happened in TLJ and actually stuck with it and continued with the storyline, because there really was nowhere else he could have taken it. So, once again, Abrams saves the Star Wars franchise, with his excellent sense of direction and care for the series, while also taking some risks but still keeping it grounded, believable as well as enjoyable. Also, John Williams is as amazing as ever with his absolutely incredible score! Bringing true emotion to these films like no other composer could ever do. I recommend this movie for Star Wars veterans and casual movie-goers alike. I give this movie 4.5/5 stars for it's surprising and gratifying conclusion to the sequel trilogy, and for the outstanding performances given by Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver.",4.5

It was easy to follow even though I could barely remember what the last Sith, Clones, Kylo Daryh Vader wannabe blah, blah, blah movies were about.

The plot somehow manages to be incredibly overcomplicated and unbelievably dumb at the same time, which echoes screenwriter Chris Terrio's previous attempt at a blockbuster, Batman V Superman. Performances are fine, everyone was doing their best with what they were given. Visuals are great, certain scenes have some unbelievable art design. Cinematography leaves much to be desired following The Last Jedi. If you're a big follower of Star Wars lore and canon I really think this will leave you really grasping at straws trying to piece together how the sequel trilogy makes sense within the Star Wars universe after this one. But after all that, it's not a film without it's fun. There are numerous scenes that are exciting and fun, it just struggles to combine those scenes into a coherent whole. I know I sounded like I completely ragged on the film and I have, but I mean there are plenty of not-so-great Star Wars films.",2.0

I see how JJ Abrams would copy over some of the original styles that Lucas used throughout the series, I even enjoy the historical element he adds to most of his work(ruins of empire ships in key locations from the past), but the character arrangement and acting were sorely lacking, no... it just sucked. Poor chemistry and unconvincing acting in many ridiculous/unbelievable situations.  I was not drawn-in, I did not wonder what happens next, I did not hope for another movie like it. This is a foreign way to be in regards to Star Wars movies. Lucas always ""took you on a wild ride"" emotionally AND through action scenarios. This movie only gets a 2nd star because it (I think) closed-out the series with the information conveyed in this movie. However, it's just pitiful when you can get cameos from all 2 dead characters and still have Carrie Fisher in this one for half the movie and STILL manage an extremely lack-luster movie. I was actually F%()! BORED for 75% of this almost 3 hour movie. WTH Disney??",2.0

A minor one is that it seemed like a redditors wish list. They had a lot of little moments in the movie where you can tell the writers went on the internet and searched what do people want to see happen in Star Wars for little things like chewy getting his medal.

Jedi or not....leave Luke and Han dead!!  The middle part of the movie is a snooze fest!  Plotless, ,boring and predictable!  And then the whole.... Ray kills Kylo and  brings Kylo back to life but kills Leia in the process so that Kylo can bring Leia back to life only for him to die immediately after bringing her back from the dead?!?  WTF?!?!

Finding a way to properly complete a trilogy storyline, while trying to use the TLJ, is a daunting task.  TROS finds a way to take Rey's unrealistic power level and use it to find a conclusion that both Nu Fans and OG Fans can enjoy.  It has alot of fan service, but it doesn't go too much over the top.  Overall, TROS was a no-win situation, but Abrams found a way to make decent lemonade from rotten lemons.",4.0

13852,DEKKA129,"Jan 04, 2020","I've now seen Rise of Skywalker three times.

First time, I really didn't like it that much. It felt too frenetic, rushed, and lacking in room for the scenes and characters to breathe.

Second time, I liked it but didn't love it. I kind of caught the rhythm of it a bit more, and I noticed a bit more of the breathing room I'd felt was utterly lacking the first time I saw it. And there were a lot of moments that I really liked. But still, the most I could say in terms of ranking it with the other films was that at least it beat the prequel films for me. 

This last time, my third viewing, I teared up three different times. Chewie's reaction when he heard about Leia dying, the moment when Lando and the massive armada of starships show up (and I don't quite know why that particular moment got me - Williams' score, maybe?) and then finally when everyone was back together celebrating at the very end (again, I think it was partly my inner 9 year-old reacting to John Williams' score, but the moment between Finn, Rey and Poe genuinely got me too.)

It still isn't top among the Star Wars films for me. The original film, Empire Strikes Back and Rogue One are still my top tier. But Rise of Skywalker has definitely grown on me since my first viewing.  Same thing happened with The Last Jedi too. But I dig it, imperfections and all, and suspect that an extended edit could make it a lot better still. It still feels to me like a three hour movie trimmed down to 2:20. But even so, it gets the job done and looks phenomenal while doing so.",4.0

Do you honestly care for the characters? I didn't, unless it was the OT characters which were used as throwaways (with the exception of Chewie).

I liked the film thoroughly and believe it is a solid 8.5 out of 10. Yes, there are a few aspects that do not live up to the originals or Rogue One, but this moving is anything but boring.

However, most of the movie felt like they tried to cram as much fan service into the film as they possibly could. By the end, the movie had so many cloying or melodramatic plot turns and overblown effects scenes that it felt more like a Michael Bay Transformers film than Star Wars. However, after a few hours, I was left with the memories of the interactions between Kylo and Rey, which were by far the best parts of the film.

Its just bad  writing and directing to have character who can fly and leap huge distances to then struggle to climb a tower (Face palm). The movie is long places where it should short, sappy about losing someone who we theoretically dont know is dead, and why can some Jedi be powerful ghosts while others just die???

14199,Rick M,"Jan 05, 2020","Not as bad as the general consensus makes it out to be - perhaps there is just too many feelings around the Skywalkers/Jedi history & canon that Disney would do well to continue with non-connected characters like in ‘Rogue One’ and ‘The Mandelorean’.  It’s time to finally leave the classic character behind and safe.  If this movie serves to help the audience appreciate the underrated ‘The Last Jedi’ a little more - another movie trying to focus more on our new characters of Rey, Finn, Poe, & Kylo - I’ll appreciate it.  ‘The Rise of Skywalker’ proves a fitting transitional/“ending” chapter, but does not cross into the higher tier of ‘Star Wars’ films like ‘Empire’, ‘Revenge’, ‘Rogue’,  (‘Last Jedi’, IMO), and the original ‘New Hope’.  ‘Skywalker’ will rank somewhere amongst the middling films: ‘Return’, ‘Attack’, & ‘Force Awakens’.",3.0

The special effects were good, but I think we have already seen too many aerial battles in aircraft and too many swordfights with light sabers. I don't want to sound like a hater. It was mostly pretty good.",3.0

14225,Walter,"Jan 05, 2020","The Star Wars saga finally ended in silence, just as it began. I was hopeful that JJ Abrams could bring us a memorable ending, but he fell short of that goal. Seems that all of the sequels and prequels had the same plot, just with different characters. They had to resort to bringing back long-dead Jedi to remind us this movie was somehow connected to the original George Lucas masterpiece. Some cute, new characters but many were just human bodies with some animal or fish-type head on top. Strange? And the storm troopers! They must be the worst army in history as they never hit anybody in the main cast and get killed like toy soldiers. Same goes for the New Order fleet, which looked so imposing yet was easily destroyed by a small fleet of junked star fighters. All in all, very disappointing and have to admit I nodded out a few times during the way too long debacle.",3.0

Overall JJ did a good job trying to wrap up loose ends, answer questions, and do fan service with the original characters. This film much more like an original Star Wars film. I walked out satisfied and really enjoyed the movie. Nice work JJ.",4.0

14339,Gary V,"Jan 05, 2020","I am a sci-fi lover.  But Ive never put on a costume or attended a convention.  Ive also loved the Star Wars series because of its cutting edge approach in story line as well as filming techniques.  It used to be fearless... a kind of us against them attitude that said if you like this film youre cool, if you dont youre an idiot.  So, watching this latest offering smacked of just how far the mighty have fallen.  It was as if the P.C. Culture police had an office on the film set.  There wasnt a pet cultural icon missing.  It was as if the makers thought that checking off the list of expected P.C. inclusions would earn them favor with the powerful.  

And the script had moments where I could have written better.  At one time someone said something like the galaxy is watching... oh please.   I do however give points for attempting to bring all the dangling story lines from past efforts into some kind of closure.  And the use of cutting edge technology was as wonderful as ever.  Having a major star present in the film long after her passing was beyond simply being impressive.  And placing vintage footage of faces in modern costumes really passed the thats cool test.  

But the star of the project in my opinion was John Williams.  The final battle sequence and subsequent victory party was Mr. Williams at his best.  The iconic use of musical themes for various characters or emotions was expected.  But I was impressed in the fact that John Williams could have just coasted past the finish line with a good enough score.  But this was a new level of excellence... even for him.  Absolutely breathtakingly delicious.  

In all... without taking all this too seriously... if the objective was to entertain... they succeeded fully.  Could it have been better in my opinion... yes.  But when all is said and done, it continued the series objective in one word...  FUN.",4.0

The nonsensical stuff in the final battle (horses running on a flying Star Destroyer?) just made the movie non-dramatic. 
Lazy writing to close the plot-lines and sometimes shameless nods to previous movies trying to play to the long term fans, but in the end felt insulting. Its like someone said, we have to show Jawas and Ewoks somehow.",2.0

Abrams tied up the series neatly, bringing all the storylines to their conclusions, and it all felt just right to me.  I thought Ridley did a really fine performance as a more mature Rey, and gave the final journey of the story a greater depth of emotion.  The 
 comradarie of Rey, Finn and Poe fit right in with the original cast.  The technical job of fiting in Carrie Fisher with old footage was astounding, you would never know it was pieced together.  (As for the ""professional"" reviews I read before seeing it, I have a hard time believing they actually saw the movie or cared for the series, they were so off.)

14622,Kashif L,"Jan 06, 2020","SPOILER ALERT: This movie felt like Season 8 of Game of Thrones. All that setup in the previous seasons that leads up to a half-assed attempt to wrap up the story. Although TROS is not as bad as GOT Season 8, it feels sloppy and lazy as if to wrap up the story of Rey and Kylo Ren. The movie has a lot of tell but no show. In the movie when Palpatine has Rey pinned down with the force lightning, and all of jedi speak to Rey as if to encourage her, this would have been a great time to utilize the Fan Service that this movie likes to throw out at random times and show all of the Jedi helping Rey to repel the lighting. (Similar to Dragonball Z when Goku’s ghost helps Gohan with a Kamehameha). The movie is entertaining though. My biggest gripe with the movie though is that how is this movie going to be called RISE OF THE SKYWALKER when the the original Skywalker ANAKIN “DARTH VADER” SKYWALKER does not even show up in the film. Such a missed opportunity. I understand that Rey never met him and why Luke and Leia’s ghost show up at the end but for a movie that has so much fan service, you would think they would do it here. This also brings me to my next point. DISNEY hates the prequels 1-3 and it shows in this movie through the fan service.",3.0

Carrie Fishers scenes were always going to be lifted from last Jedi outtakes (due to her death), but theyre really obvious, if you get what Im saying.
I did like the movie. It was fun.
But it felt like they shouldve made it a 2-parter,
And it wouldve been good if theyd given more time to foreshadowing a certain OG characters storyline.
All-in-all, 
Id rate it 3-3.5 out of 5.

14777,Nathan,"Jan 06, 2020","Let me start off by saying I am not a Star Wars fan boy.  I enjoy the movies but the comparisons to the originals and not viewing the newest trilogy on it's own merit is not how I go into these movies.  I felt the first movie in this trilogy, Force Awakens was good while The Last Jedi had some serious pacing issues.  Now that we have a basis of opinion to build off of, here is my review:  This movie is what I want out of a 2 1/2 hour movie.  It's a strong mix of action then story, action then story.  I never felt the lulls that came with the second movie, The Last Jedi.  The story was entertaining but surface level.  This movie wrapped up storylines rather than expand on anything new.  Overall, it's a Star Wars movie.  You know what you are getting yourself into.  Though they are not all created equal, this one is definitely worth seeing.",4.0

I am a die hard Star Wars fan and I had watched my favorite youtubers talk about the movie for the past year or so and I went in expecting it to suck, but it was really good.

But, I am old enough to remember when The Empire Strikes Back was in theaters. I went to see it with my family and loved the experience! If I had instead seen The Rise of Skywalker, I would have been blown away even more. We tend to forget the shortcomings of the previous films which we have based all our fandom in the first place. Were we to judge New Hope as harshly, would it stand up to our scrutiny? I doubt it. We have been swept up in the collective tide of cultural mythology which exists now for Star Wars. We all need to relax and appreciate just how amazing our story-telling has become since 1977. The Rise of Skywalker was a great film. Flawed, yes.

Fast paced and full of action still a good popcorn movie with lots of fan service. And yes that is a good thing, you make movies for people that want to see them. At times you see some great interaction between the main cast and it is evident what the trilogy could have been had Disney and Rian Johnson no horrendously screwed up the second film. However some of the new force powers shown are terribly OP, force healing seems natural and realistic to me and similar to other force powers. But resurrection from the dead, force lightning that destroys entire fleets, transportation of material objects across the galaxy through a mind connection? Stupid.",3.0

14864,S K,"Jan 06, 2020","Better than Star Wars 8 but not better than any other Star Wars.  Star Wars 8 was tied for worst Star Wars along side SW 1  Phantom Menace, so Star Wars 9 is only slightly better.  
The Good: A fight scenes are good, a lot less agenda.  
The Bad: Movie is rushed and crammed with too much half-baked story line.
The Ugly: Continues butchery of Force powers adding things that just don't make sense.  Includes all kinds of jumps in story that really are bad.  

Summary: While the names and characters still exist, SW 9 like SW 8 pretends that the other 7 movies didn't exist. Why they butcher a story world and replace it with nothing good or consistent is beyond me.  If SW 9 was the first in the series there never would have been a series.",3.0

I am a Sci Fi fan first and foremost, Star trek fan 2nd, Star Wars fan 3rd.....
Has anyone seen this old old 2 movies called.... uhhh let me think.... ""Empire Strikes Back""? ""Return Of The Jedi""?

""Rise of Skywalker""
Which should be named ""Reruns of Skywalker and Pals""

If you have seen those you will have already seen this... ""Rise of Skywalker"" - Same theme - ""I am your father"" - YES - I am related to you and YOU don't know it?
Different people, different characters - SAME STORY

In True JJ fashion there are a lot of setups with no pay off( I need to tell you...., Storm Troopers rebel....., Horses one a Star Ship.....)

14978,ALVIN H,"Jan 06, 2020",The “last” movie in the Star Wars Skywalker canon is both a present and disappointment to both fans and new moviegoers. J.J. Abrams took the same idea of the Force Awakens and “tries” to incorporate a sensible plot after Rian Johnson’s last Star Wars movie the Last Jedi. After it was announced that J.J. Abrams was replacing the original director for Episode X we can see this was strictly a movie grab decision by Disney. All I can say is ....just enjoy the ending. Star War fans deserves better from Disney,4.0
14979,MARYANN M,"Jan 07, 2020","I enjoyed the movie, but I felt that the previous movie, THE LAST JEDI,  was better.  I feel like they could have developed the characters a bit more, however, that would have made the movie longer and it already quite long.",4.0

I could tell pretty early from the tone and cinematography that I would ay least like it...& I did. Was it perfect? No. But then, what is? It was good enough. Good enough that I laughed, cried, jumped in my skin, clutched my seat and felt all the nostalgia of 40 years of Star Wars. If I could commission the makers to tinker with it another 6 months to achieve that epic perfection few films attain, sure, I would but was I satisfied at the end.

To really enjoy this, you have to love “Star Wars” for what it is — a great adventure story with unusual characters and heart. Is it perfect? Nope. But it’s ties up the narratives threads nicely and keeps the spirit of the original film intact. And if you have the opportunity, go see it at a 4DX theater. The motion seats and in-theater effects enhance the 3D in really cool ways that make you an active viewer in the adventure.",3.5

So many liberties were taken with the original canon that I left the theater feeling used, as if discovering the love of my life is only after my money. As if the filmmakers were simply checking off boxes. Sarcastic banter? Check. Bromance? Check. I had no concern for the characters most of the time, not that the actors were at fault (most performances were fine), but the story and script they had to work with were self-conscious, banal and paper-thin, full of cliches. I know you can't recreate the awe and wonder of the first films, any more than you can re-live your first kiss, but at least give me a little passion ...some inspiration. This movie had very little of that. It's just another pretty face, that happens to be blessed with a once-glorious family name.",2.0

You want to know how he came back? Don't ask its not important apparently.  If you want to get any explanation of key plot points you will need to read comics, the visual dictionary, and other source material to attempt to make sense.  The Knights of Ren were laughable and were only there to sell merchandise. There were no consequences to anything in the movie, multiple deaths instantly reversed, it was a mess.",1.5

Meh. It's really starting to bother me how they humanize Stormtroopers without helmets (Finn for instance, and his new friends on yaks) yet mercilessly slaughter thousands along the way. That along the way with (once again) showing entire planets being destroyed without barely a notice and zero emotional impact.

I recommend this movie. It moves quickly, delivers sumptuous visuals (too much if you are photosensitive) and ties up enough loose ends that it is a fitting ending to a story that simply got too complex for its own good.

I don’t by Raes struggles and see her grow into a Jedi, because every thing comes to easily. I don’t by any of the relationships between any of the characters. It’s  a microwave relationship. Instant best friend, instant love interest, I couldn’t by into it. I had no suspension of disbelief. I haven’t since they rebooted it, it’s just gotten worse. I don’t like being negative, unfortunately I’m not able to pretend this was worth my money or my time.",1.5

The acting is quality (regrettably, it is evident that the late Carrie Fisher has been created through technology), and it is a fitting tribute to General Organa, Han Solo, and Luke and the Skywalker story.

The new force powers cheapen everything about the prior trilogy’s and show how laziness has replaced good story tellingly Lucas films.  I tried to like the new trilogy from day one but have been disappointed at every turn.  I wish I could wash it out of my consciousness and forget what I’ve seen.   Alas Star Wars has become a thing of childhood and as an adult you mast put away childish thing.  On a side note why the emperor why didn’t Snooke reveal to Ren that he foresaw his betrayal and substituted a clone and further reveal himself as Darth Plaugus instead of ruining the original trilogy?  I wouldn’t hire writer so inept again if I wanted to make a good movie.  Just a thought.,1.5

While I enjoyed some more than others, I always loved the experience of being taken back to these worlds and getting reaquainted with the characters.

The films last act, beginning with the last-ditch assault of the Resistance, has some heavy lifting to do.

Was hoping for a Mandalorian tie-in, given the timeline of the show and movie's releases, but not a huge disappointment.

15441,DELETED USER,"Jan 08, 2020","The ""final"" installment of the Skywalker Saga is well-worth the watch, so long as expectations are managed. Unfortunately, the Rise of Skywalker suffers from being attached to a weak link in The Last Jedi — a movie I recently re-watched and enjoyed much more than on my first viewing, but still hurts the overall plot of the final installments to the ennead. An example would be even hinting at Palpatine's ascendance earlier in the series than merely standing alone in the final episode. The long-run time doesn't flow as smoothly as expected and was choppy throughout. Some quality dialogue (and funny) and others were cringe-worthy — I know difficult with Carrie Fisher passing away, so not taking off for that. Finn and Rose (who apparently is still alive and well?) are not still a thing? And Finn gets potentially his third love interest in three movies? Finn's arc was always my least favorite and hurt the most from The Last Jedi. I know I'm going to sound like a hypocrite here because I had asked for more light-saber battles in the earlier movies, but… did we get too much light-sabering here? I thought Rey's arc was the most complete and entertaining, even if the writers botched her final line (which, I understand, would require changing the title). I hated what they did with Chewie — either kill-off a beloved character or let him escape, but don't do both, it's offensive to the audience. And although a tear came to my eye when the full resistance fleet appeared I couldn't help but wonder: Where were these motherfuckers during the past two movies?! All that being said, The Rise of Skywalker was an enjoyable experience — it's a space adventure, after all — and definitely worth seeing in theaters. I think it fits nicely enough as the center pillar between The Force Awakens (90) and The Last Jedi (78).",4.5
15442,Anthony J F,"Jan 08, 2020","Overall, I found the movie enjoyable.  I didn't leave disappointed but I was hoping for something a bit more original.

15525,NORM,"Jan 09, 2020","2nd viewing after seeing it in Chicago just before Christmas. Just finished re-viewing The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi to see if it would add anything. Didnt see the end credits in Chicago but did today. The music was fantastic! One last time! 

Other than the music end credits, my opinion didn't change significantly. Got a lot more detail this time around. But I have to say that Finn and Poe Dameron are not particularly memorable characters in this epic space-opera spanning 1977-2019, and the fact that Rey with very little Jedi training could do all she did with the Force. Again, just my minor opinion.  Oh well... 

Generally enjoyable throughout the nine films. My three favorites are definitely IV. A New Hope, V. The Empire Strikes Back, and VI. Return of the Jedi. One of my favorite characters in the saga was actually Count Dooku (Darth Tyranus), and wished they could have explored his character a bit more. The end of an era. May the Force be with you!",3.0

This is a ""closure"" movie to a series and does need to wrap up its multiple story lines - thus the frentic pace and length.

15661,Neil  B,"Jan 09, 2020","My one dislike of this movie was that it is very fast-paced: JJ Abrams had a lot to do in this movie after the debacle of The Last Jedi. This often leads to some weakly developed and sometimes dropped plot lines.

Despite this, the movie ran that line as good as it could have and it was a wonderful wrap-up to the 42 year history of the Skywalker saga. I hope to see some characters and stories spun off from this and hope that JJ Abrams gets to steer those stories in some capacity. I don't think his original vision was given enough of a chance with this trilogy.

I really believe that had JJ's original draft of this trilogy been followed more closely after the Force Awakens and in The Last Jedi, this movie would have had a chance to slow down the pace and dig deeper into some of the character's back stories. Let's hope there is an extended directors cut released at some point.",4.5

15677,Maurene H,"Jan 09, 2020","I enjoyed the movie connecting the dots from the early days to the last days of the story.  Small screen shots of old, original characters was awesome.  The story telling with General Lela was overdone because knowing that she (Carrie Fisher) had passed sometime ago did not feel right or real to me!  The special affects were wonderful and allowed George Lucas to finish with all the bang that he originally wanted.  It is Star Wars, what is not to love.  I think all the main characters were there except for Yoda and Obe Wan.  Nice finish..",5.0

This is still a must see for any Star Wars fan, but not up to snuff like many of the others. Its still head and shoulders above any of the prequels, but something is still missing here.

The movie did feel like it tried to make many call backs to the original trilogy, some of which felt forced. But, the great character reveals, and the unity projected at the end, left me satisfied with the conclusion of a tale that has spanned my whole life.

The 3D IMAX experience was cool, but not really worth more than standard admission for this film. The quick transitions between shots made it difficult to appreciate the visual effects on the ginormous screen.

15901,T!M,"Jan 10, 2020","A truly uninspiring finale to what should have been the greatest big-screen adventure of our generation. Every part of Rise of Skywalker feels contrived and mediocre. The characters take a back seat to unbelievably awkward plot choices and convoluted worldbuilding that’s as thick as a jungle and every bit as unkempt. It’s clear at every turn that Disney and Abrams worked feverishly to walk back each one of the interesting decisions Johnson made in The Last Jedi, making it abundantly clear that Abrams is great at regurgitating stories, but possesses no real spark of originality. The emotional weight of the trilogy’s most interesting characters gets sidelined by flashy visuals and ill attempts to shock the audience, and each moment intended to make a resounding impact simply falls utterly flat. Rey is suddenly a completely uninteresting heroine, with new connections that dodge the greater emotional implications of her arc in the previous two films, while simultaneously cheapening her arc in this one. We’re expected to believe that she’s been genuinely tempted to the dark side when we’ve only ever seen her get a little miffed here and there, and that she—by herself—has the strength that the most accomplished Jedi masters at the height of the Jedi Order did not. Beyond that, the one great shining light throughout this whole trilogy—Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren—gets utterly deflated and turned into a dopey awkward child with no real sacrifice to justify a redemption (and significantly less motivation than Vader had as he watched his son—one of the last connections to his departed wife—get tortured to death). It’s clear Disney wanted to answer fan questions, however their obsession to address every single one of them means they don’t really answer any of them at all (see: Snoke). Overall it’s a very disappointing ramble through the bits of a galaxy far far away that no one ever really cared to see, driven at a breakneck pace that seems to hope you won’t ask questions if they just move fast and get it over with as soon as possible. As a pretty hardcore fan of the Star Wars franchise very few things have left me as disappointed as this film. I also feel like I should say my cold response wasn’t the result of me expecting to see my own story ideas or the choices I would have made on the screen, i think I was just hoping for a cohesive conclusion to a three-film saga that respected each installment and allowed the characters to grow in organic ways. They could have easily ripped this script off of a reddit post that was upset about The Last Jedi. At the very least they buttoned up the story well enough that none of us should ever have to look at these dismal characters on the big-screen ever again—and for that I can say I’m grateful Rey is the last Jedi.",0.5

Everything that happened in the film, where the story was taken and how it inevitably ""ended"" the saga was just pitiful. I couldn't tell if Abrams was creating something new and unique for Star Wars is if he was just trying to provide damage control to a movie that die hard fans despised. Disney did really well with this movie regarding the visuals, and the music was just spectacular. I found that the main villain was wasted, and all the other small villains were just boring or misused. A lot of the supporting roles (and the main roles) were basic and dull. Adam Driver did a good job, I guess - he did as good as anyone could do with what he was given.

Its like they take you back to someplace that maybe was in the first movie or what are the others and then its almost like this feeling of hello and goodbye forever..,4.0

I've seen all of the Star Wars movies in the theater as soon as they were released, so yes I'm an old fan! The only ones I didn't care for were The Clone Wars, Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith.

I believe it would have made more sense and had more direction if it was a standalone film. This movie was your typical scavenger hunt adventure film. The acting was great and the visuals were awesome, as typically in-line with every Star Wars film.  However, the misses were major. The storyline was jumbled and certain scenes made no sense (horses running on a spaceship midflight).  Overall, trilogy lost its direction after the first film and never could recover.",1.5

16024,THE Aaron Carroll,"Jan 11, 2020","Star Wars Rise of Skywalker was an okay movie. This installment was entertaining but leading up to the release was so incredibly overhyped that no matter how good it actually was it was never going to live up to that hype. This Star Wars movie had too much going on and never felt cohesive enough to flesh out the characters and tie off the many unfinished character archs. The ending was too predictable in this good vs. evil plot line. While the Star Wars lore, music, sounds and familiar characters new and old were evident this Star Wars installment and final film of The Skywalker Saga could never live up the lofty, impossible to reach expectations set before it. This is an average and ultimately safe-to-a-fault jump through hyper space type movie. Fun and entertaining but average at best.",3.0

There's less of a feminism push in this film which was refreshing. The film was rushed in the end, and it would've been better if it was longer. All in all, it's the best out of this trilogy. Considering episode 8 committed the greatest error of cinematic history in killing off Luke Skywalker, and making him a recluse, there wasn't anything J.J. Abrams could've done worse than that. It's a somewhat satisfying end to these 3 films.",4.0

16130,David,"Jan 12, 2020","For all those who say they won't go see it because they believe that J.J. Abrams ruined the story, or some other rumor about the film, I say Balderdash!
Having been a fan of Star Wars since 1977's original, seeing it brought to a close the way it was, brought tears to my eyes with a smile on my face!
The way it ends, with Rey returning to Luke's home on Tattoine, when asked her name and she says ""Rey...Skywalker"" was perfect!
It was a fitting ending and tribute to Carrie Fisher as well.
I will most definitely see it again before it leaves the theatres, if just to catch things I missed the first time!",5.0

16153,ArmchairCriticSF,"Jan 12, 2020","Great visuals & special effects (that's to be expected from a Star Wars film, though, isn't it?). But apart from this, honestly, it's kind of a mess. The story feels rushed, and there's just TOO MUCH they're trying to cram in. It's certainly better than The Last Jedi, but that's really not saying much, as The Last Jedi was TERRIBLE. I suppose it (this film) is entertaining on a surface level, so audiences will probably ENJOY it, but when you get to thinking about it, it just doesn't make much sense. I give it 3 stars for not being absolutely TERRIBLE, but it is predictably (considering the previous 2 films) muddled. An unworthy end to the Skywalker saga, but after decades of desecrating Star Wars, I must say, I'm kind of glad it's finally over. Put Star Wars - and us - out of our collective misery, and just let dead dogs lie, for Christ's sake. Let it be.",3.0

16198,Joseph,"Jan 12, 2020","To start off, this movie is basically split into two parts: Part one is director JJ Abrams addressing all the “mistakes”, “missteps”, and conflicting plot lines that exist between what he set up in The Force Awakens, and what Rian Johnson developed in The Last Jedi. The second half is Abrams now building on what he created and set up in The Force Awakens to excellent climax. Right off the bat, it’s the best of the Sequels. It’s got its issues, like pacing (this movie definitely needed an extra 30 minutes to iron out the wrinkles), and some questions still left unanswered. However, it’s magical, and captivating like any good Star Wars film should be. It possesses the right balance of fan service and originality that The Force Awakens couldn’t reach in new material, and what The Last Jedi absolutely lacked in nostalgia. Any fan of the originals and the prequels will love this movie. It’s without a doubt a shining gem in the pile of “fake diamonds and cheap stones” that make up the Sequel Trilogy.",4.0

He managed to pull it all off with a clever, fun, interesting, and exciting movie while recovering from a lot of odd decisions made by Rian Johnson. The actors had more to work with, the script was better, the storyline was good. The characters were used better, and the ending was solid.

Dislike: Everything else. Regardless of how anyone felt about the last movie, the fact that so much of this movie is spent undoing TLJ is at best counter productive. There is zero logic or internal consistency, I counted at least half a dozen character deaths that were quickly undone within the film. While it can be hard to gauge the intent of a filmmaker, they probably didn't want me laughing out loud during their big dramatic moments, and yet, here we are. 

The difference between an error and a mistake is simple. Anyone can commit an error, but it doesn't become a mistake until you refuse to correct it. The sequel trilogy thus ends as a huge, pretty looking, and very expensive mistake.",1.0

16406,DELETED USER,"Jan 13, 2020","The Rise of Skywalker is interesting. The editing is so erratic and quick that you can tell they wanted to put as much as possible in this film. I'm honestly exhausted from it. It would have benefited from longer run time to let moments breathe. It really felt like they tried to cram two films into this one (for one reason or another). I really hope there is a 3-hour directors cut released at some point. I cannot confirm this but I don't think they abided by the conventional Star Wars pacing chart (google it) and therefore it doesn't have the cadence of a regular Star Wars film.

That being said... welp... it's very hard not to say anything without spoiling it. Like Endgame or Infinity War, you cant talk about the content (even vaguely) without spoiling it cause it moves so fast. However, I'd say that the film gave me whiplash. Reveals happen so quickly that it's hard to take in the last thing that happened. So quick that some setups are immediately paid off within a single scene. It has no time to pump the breaks at all. There isn't really an A and B plot but a super-strong A plot that just plows through the story.

As a Star Wars fan, there are some moments that I almost loathe but also some moments that I really love. It's a fast-moving mixed bag but it finishes the Saga adequately. Old lines and quips come back full force and are nestled into the fabric of this movie. Definitely see it for yourself and talk to me about it.",3.0

I liked the movie and seeing the nine-part epic (starting in 1977) completed. 
The picture and sound were awesome and the movie had the fun and adventurous vibe of A New Hope. 

The first one-third of the movie was cool but didn't totally grab me. 
But those plot surprises in the middle (the ghosts of Han and Luke) really kick-started things for me. 
The last two-thirds were stupendous, especially the space battle and confrontation between Rey and Emperor Palpatine. 
I'm glad Poe was named general. I liked the various alien characters introduced, too. 
I think Rey and Finn had their strongest performances in this movie.",3.5

It of course had it's problems but those are inevitable as it is such a complex franchise. I was very hesitant to see this film due to how incredibly horrible the last one was but I was pleasantly surprised. I loved seeing new characters as well as old.

Honestly – I didnt care about what happened to any of the characters good or bad totally not vested in any of them.

This film is called Rise of Skywalker. MEH!!!!!! Totally failed to deliver.

This movie makes it perfectly clear that there was no plan whatsoever going in to this trilogy. Disney treated it like some high-budget action serial like Fast and the Furious. Rian Johnson wrote them into a corner and JJ Abrams did an admirable job considering the state of what he was handed. The missed opportunities were legion. Disney could have made something incredible, but they squandered it in a rush to make a quick buck. I've been a fan since 1977, but I no longer feel connected to this franchise.

16690,DELETED USER,"Jan 15, 2020","I think we've learned that all Star Wars movies are fun to watch regardless of quality, including this one. The fan service here is top notch. However, as part of a trilogy this movie is very confusing. It abandons almost everything the Last Jedi brought to the trilogy, likely because that film received luke-warm audience reactions. This makes this feel like a standalone film rather than part of a trilogy. The plot of this film could be split up into a trilogy on its own since it pulls almost nothing from the previous two, and that creates a lot of confusion throughout the movie. Palpatine's return is interesting, if not cliche, but the film doesn't have time to stop and explain the parts of this story that are really going to eat at you once you've left the theater. The Emperor, the main antagonist of the entire main series, having a son is revealed in such an ""oh by the way"" manner that you could almost miss it. This isn't explained in any more detail and should be a much bigger deal than it is made to be. Just throwing it in as a minor detail makes it feel unimportant and also makes it clear that this is just trying to quickly cut what Rey was told in The Last Jedi and paste the ""you're actually related to this powerful bad guy"" trope from the original trilogy. His return is explained in the same ""oh by the way"" manner and this keeps these things from feeling real. You have to be able to suspend disbelief in these kinds of movies, but when things are thrown into the plot in this fashion it's clear that it's scuffed writing that's responsible for this and that takes you out of the experience completely. I understand much this was an attempt to undo what was done in The Last Jedi, but deviating from the core plot of the film that this one is supposed to conclude creates a broken story. This could have continued to expand upon those plot lines and made them more satisfying rather than trying to delete them, potentially leaving both films in a much better light. That film was the only one in the trilogy to try something new, and not trying to work with what it did makes this one feel like it doesn't belong.",3.0

I've seen IX 3 times and loved it the most the third time. There are a couple of things that could have been better explained, and there are a couple of abrupt scene changes. It also takes seeing it a few times to follow everything as it's happening. But I think the retcon complaints are ridiculous, and overall, it is a lot of fun and emotionally satisfying.

Really feels like 2 movies in one and not in a good way. It causes the story to become really congested and the way events unfold to just be really convenient. However, nailed the ending for the saga as a whole. First watch is too much to process, gonna have to give it at least one or two more views to grasp it.",3.5

16857,James  E,"Jan 17, 2020","My guess is that Disney was still overhyped on how much money Avengers: Endgame made them, so they wanted to do that again with this film. Because this movie is packed with fan service. With Lando making several apperiences, Emperor Palpatine coming back from the dead (which also makes Darth Vader's sacrifice in Return of the Jedi meaningless,) and overall nonsencical plot elements used for the sake of pleasing the audience. Which, looking at the audience score, it sort of did. But not me. Star Wars seems to have lost any kind of purpose in itself now. Even though the prequels aren't all that good, at least you could tell they had a story that someone acually wanted to tell, and it wasn't all for the money. I'm not saying any spoilers, but you know they're going to make a new trilogy soon after this. If I'm right, they might be even worse.",1.5

However, like its predecessors, they did a lot of things right as well. sprinkled in between the down right cringy moments, mostly involving Fin, there were moments that remind you why this franchise means so much to so many people. The story was predictable but in all the right ways, the acting was passable, and the action was digestible and not overwhelming. All in all, I would say its turned it place in the hallowed halls of the Star Wars Empire.",3.5

I was super sad the first time I saw the end, and I cant say why because it is a spoiler. I loved the surprises but that may be because I dont watch the adds. I like to be surprised and to go on the journey of a fine storyteller. So I go back to enjoy all the details and bits I am sure I missed the first time I saw it. I think I will go again and take my friend who read all these bad reviews, I told her it is great. I was in college when I saw the first Star Wars IV in the movie theater when it first came out. I loved Star Trek and when I saw Star Wars I was so immersed I cant remember who my date was, it was a game changer in the Sci-fi world. Thank you Lucas. Over the years I introduced these movies to my children who passed it on to my grandchildren who are big time Star Wars enthusiasts. Thanks to all the actors, designers, writers, computer whizzes and so many more who made all these movies possible.",5.0

16986,Ly,"Jan 18, 2020","I don't know much about movies film making wise, but I do know a little about acting, scene direction and overall screenplay. This movie was indeed an extremely improved storyline over the previous episode. There was no obvious evidence of political agenda in this movie and to an extent the outcome the characters come to doesn't make them foolish beyond measure. What I did not like was the theme used about choosing your family with the specific character chosen for that message. It's just a pet peeve, but a character should not look like a clone of another character and barely resemble the parents.  I recognize with the loss of Carrie there was some script tweaks for her character as well but it was amazing to see how far we've come with special effects and such. It was also nice to see some of the original star wars cast return not just for a cameo, but for a significant part of the plot line.",4.0

It's a solid stand alone film and utilizes the entire timeline.  what the film needed was more story development.  Ep. XI was not rushed persay, but it felt like too much time was spent explaining everything that was going on.  It would have benefited from a ep. VIII that built up to XI.",4.0
16988,Caro,"Jan 18, 2020","Im a fanatic and I LOVED this ending. The whole thing. Start to the Rise of Skywalker! Saw it twice, once IMAX 3D and once plain 3D, which is of the best quality Ive ever seen.

The movie is thrilling, complete, easy to follow, and ties all nine episodes up beautifully. It leaves plenty of room for rogue future movies without leaving you feeling things were left out in the three trilogies. 

The acting was terrific, best of all 9. General Organa / Princess Leia / Carrie Fisher masterfully lives, adding what probably wouldnt have been less storyline than originally planned. There were maybe just a couple of odd artificial forced scenes that were dupes from earlier episodes - too short to detract. And Im pretty sure the catch in her comrades voices when they addressed her were real, for obvious reasons. 

Maybe best of all for me, whose friends and family are not SW buffs, this is fully enjoyable as a stand-alone star force adventure, without having seen any other episode or knowing much about the plot arc. Though it helps to know a LITTLE. 

It has all kinds of Easter eggs and homages, maybe more than usual. Look for references to Dune, Twilight Zone, Battlestar Galctica, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, TriffidTrump, Star Trek, and all the other SW episodes, among others.

Rey is still overpowered, I never felt that she could fail nor that she needed anybody's help. The force is no longer used for combat but for healing and long distance communications (and teleporting objects, I guess).  The stormtroopers fly now (but only in one scene then never again).

Some characters grew and developed, but others went backwards. With all of the conflict that Rey went through to get where she did, the completion of the journey and execution felt weak. 
It was okay. I'm glad I saw it in the theatre. I was not one of those who were hard  on about how The Last Jedi was not true to the story, because it had a pretty good story and you saw how the characters were growing. Not so much this time I thought.

17338,Gregg P,"Jan 20, 2020","I thought the basic plot line was a rehash of old Star Wars, and at some point, got too syrupy sweet at end.   It was a decent Saturday night viewing and fun in that sense but it is time to call an end to these.  I think the end was bit unbelievable.  My wife left happy, and I was basically disappointed at the lack or originality.   The awe and wonder of the original series are gone, and with all the main characters gone, I'm just not as fully invested. The heroine does a nice job, and I was pleased with her character development.   Wren, not so much.",2.5

They had a quick lame mention of it like it was on the backbone. they could have shown in the end them hugging or something. They really missed the mark on that one.

However, it is still Star Wars and I still have some lingering allegiance to the franchise.   I'm relieved that we are done with the needlessly divisive final trilogy of the Skywalker saga.  If projects like The Mandalorian are any sign of things to come, then I have high hopes that Star Wars will have mass appeal again.",2.5

It was heartbreaking to see Han Solo die then another blow to see Luke killed off and then market this movie with a deceptive title sucks. The visual effects were amazing and the music was great as usual, but this was really deceptive advertising. This was Rise of Rey or Rise of Kylo Ren.

17513,John,"Jan 22, 2020","while I felt it was better then the last one, I felt that they were creating to many new Jedi powers that I think spoils the mythos. Examples: Kylo Ren being able to interact with Rey through some sort of force projection, ghost Luke being able to interact with real world objects (why wouldn't Jedi's be involved in all battles then just taking out opponents), Emperor Palentine now being able to use his lightning touch to take out a whole fleet, herring the voices of Jedi's Rey never met. It was a better mythos when not every Jedi could do everything and they are falling into the trap many movies have where they think new characters need to be even more powerful.
I also thought it would have been better if Luke's speech to Rey had a little more of an optimistic tone (I hated his character use in episode 8). It got better as it went along, but didn't come across as the wise guiding voice that Obi Wan and Yoda were for Luke, started more as a scolding rather then a questioning to make Rey think.
On the plus I liked Poe, thought he fits the role going forward of the Han Solo type character that was missing in episodes 1-3.",3.0

A bit muddled at times for me (okay, now we're searching for the what again? that you need to be able to find the huh? to then unlock the thingamajig in order to.. save the Universe, right?) but who cares. It was great fun, and such a great place to enjoy it!",3.5

17706,Steven B,"Jan 25, 2020","I struggled to stay awake during the first hour. As an original trilogy fan, I liked seeing old characters reappear, but the cameos seemed random. Ive just had a hard time connecting to the protagonists of episodes 1-3 and 7-9. They’ve lacked the charisma of Hamill, Fisher, and Ford. It was a very good cinematically and the second half did pick up, but it just lacked punch in dialogue. What memorable lines from 1-3, 7-9 can you quote in a hurry? I remember moments like Hamill tossing his light saber in 8, but not much else. The ancestral characters were just cynically leveraged to get people like me into the theater but Star Wars now belongs to another generation and not mines anymore.  I loved Lucas’s homages to Kurosawa, Lean, Fellini, etc. I won’t go to theaters to watch going forward. I’ll wait for streaming at home.",2.5

Everything is so rushed that nothing worthy of our emotions actually happen. Does anyone in this series actually die for good? Also, what happened to Rey being a ""nobody""?  Is the Force only passed through bloodline now? It seems like, unless Rey has children, the Force will cease to exist.

17814,Anthony K,"Jan 26, 2020","I’m a huge Star Wars fan, and Rise of Skywalker didn’t disappoint after the dud of The Last Jedi. Overall this installment of the saga is an action packed fun movie that ties up a lot of loose ends. Also my favorite era of Star Wars is the Clone Wars, and in one scene in particular pays homage to the Jedi of yesteryear when Rey hear’s the voices of Anakin Skywalker, Mace Windu, Yoda, Obi Wan Kenobi and more, easily my favorite scene in the film. The only thing that would really make this movie for me would be the return of Anakin Skywalker, the true Chosen One, even if he was a Force Ghost Anakin should’ve had a hand in the final destruction of Palpatine. After all George Lucas has even said Star Wars is the story of Anakin, not even Luke, and to not include him in any way  in the final chapter of the SKYWALKER Saga is a totally wrong and a huge missed opportunity, but it didn’t ruin it for me. In conclusion I highly suggest you see this one, I actually think it is the Strongest of the 3 sequel trilogy films and it’s packed with nostalgia for us that grew up with the franchise.",5.0

Rian opted not to answer those questions and upset everybody by taking u turns with the story that  nobody wanted to see. I do wish a certain relationship got its clarity or was materialized. It began to catch fire in the 1st film and the second film threw a bucket of water on it. I was hoping to see it rekindled. Oh Well. Good film overall.,4.0

About 1/3 of the jokes are okay, the other 2/3s are pretty cringe-worthy.

As fans we should file a class action lawsuit to have creative rights turned back over to George Lucas. All three movies were written as though they were cartoons. Even Palpetine wasnt the same. Lucas had a way of developing characters and telling the story that was uniquely Star Wars. Disney got it way wrong. Please just let this be the end. Dont ruin anymore of my childhood.,0.5

18041,Hazel B,"Jan 31, 2020","As a huge fan of the sequel trilogy, I couldnt be happier with this epic conclusion to the new trilogy. In my personal opinion, it also offers a fitting end to this beloved Skywalker Saga. 

The beginning part of the movie may be slow plot wise, but is chalked full of fun banter exciting chases, and character development. Fans of action may be bored, but those like me who have grown to love these new (and old!) characters will have fun throughout. 

The climax is epic and powerful, both stunt wise and emotionally. Its bittersweet, and leaves your heart aching...in a good way. Powerful tributes are paid to beloved characters and past movies that are satisfying in every way. This film is a joyous celebration of Starwars.

This film has only been out a little over a month, and already its quite controversial. Some love it. Others HATE it. 

Id say, if you are a fan of the sequel trilogy movies, (or just ALL of the movies) youll probably love this movie. 
This movie was NOT made for critics to rave over, it was instead made as a love letter to fans...while also trying to be separate for the casual movie goers.

 If you are watching this to pass the time, and you arent really a starwars fan, by all means, give it a try, but there are probably other (shorter) movies youd enjoy—and understand—better.

If you are a fan of the originals and (and/or the prequels) and didnt like The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi because they just arent what you would have written yourself, then Please, skip this one, as you probably wont like this one any better, and the last thing this movie—or all the wonderful cast and crew who worked so hard to please us and pay tribute to our beloved Starwars franchise—needs is more hate from fans who just want to see the Originals again. 

Conclusion? 

This movie is amazing. A joyful celebration of all things Starwars, worth several views. My new favorite movie. Youll love it.
But only if you have the right mindset for it. 

May the Force be with you. Always.",5.0

I loved everything about this movie, how it followed the canon, the action, twists and turns, and the ending...! Couldn't have been more classic Star Wars. However, the saga in this iteration is showing its age. The never ending theme of good vs. evil, light vs. dark will always be around, so you can't really completely kill the Darkside any more than you can the Lightside. So, I dont know of this was truly the last installment of the series, but they need to do something special for the next one.

 was in slow monition waiting for it to happen.  I'm so happy that Kylo Ren wasn't as winy as in the first two movies.  But who could blame him.  He had two mentors that didn't seem to do anything to help him develop.  I really felt Disney could have brought so much more to his character.  The action seen's were so long you almost forgot what they were doing.  They determined who Rey's family stems from but it still didn't make sense to me.  Without giving away details I won't go into it.  So I'm giving this movie a 3.5 because as far as the mythology goes in Star Wars I feel like Disney still didn't hit the mark.",3.0

How is it that the writers for Disney dont know about the fact that without tragedy, you dont have a very good drama???? How is it that writers employed by a huge company like Disney dont understand that war movies require tragedy for their drama to be effective??? 

It is sad that a 40+ year series ends in such an anticlimactic fashion, without the level of drama it deserved?  Bottom line is that a lot of characters should have died and STAYED dead for the EPIC level of tragedy and drama the series demanded. In fact, some characters should have DIED and STAYED DEAD the previous movie. NO LOSS = NO TRAGEDY = NO DRAMATIC VALUE = A DUD OF A PLOT",1.0

No part of it truly felt surprising, and despite some engaging moments the whole movie felt too much like an obligatory tie-up of loose ends, like the movie had a checklist and was just ticking them off one by one without much enthusiasm.

18214,DELETED USER,"Feb 04, 2020","Amazing. I'm obsessed. I'm a Star Wars fan and love alll the trilogies. The only people who don't like this movie haven't liked any of this new trilogy. If you enjoyed TFA you'll love this one. Way beyond my expectations!! I think the second time you see it gets even better and allows you to process what's happening more clearly. The acting, score, special effects are phenomenal, as usual. The nostalgic moments. The characters are fun. But the epic light saber fights, depth, connection, complexity, and chemistry between Rey and Kylo Ren's characters and their force bond really make the movie. I obviously have critiques, but given that the entire story wasn't thought out before the 3 movies were made makes it difficult for a super coherent seamless plot line (and villain). And after TLJ, with what JJ Abrams had to work with, I just accepted the whole Palpatine bit. To be fair, Palpatine really is the epitome of the dark side and the most terrifying sith we're all very familiar with, that's haunted both the previous trilogies so I just accepted that it would be a cool way to end the last of the Skywalker movies. My biggest critique is the very end. All the force ghosts should have been behind her. He had all the siths with him. The force ghosts should have appeared with their light sabers behind her. That would have been the ultimate hell yes!!!!! moment of the movie. Palpatine should have screamed in fear seeing them all and it would have felt like an epic justified ending with them all killing him together with her. That would have given more closure to this Skywalker saga for me, knowing that Anakin and Luke got to be part of that final take down of someone they already destroyed. Also wouldn't have minded kylo living and appearing next to Rey on Luke's planet, with Luke and Leia looking at both of them proud and at peace. And Ben and Rey standing with the moons. That would have left it more open ended as far as their future, their kids, more movies IDK GUYS lol. I loved it though so much. I don't ever write reviews but I just loved it haha.",5.0

It ties the series together, and takes is back to where it began.

18220,DELETED USER,"Feb 04, 2020","It is a solid movie. Yet the smell of ""pre-owned"" is emanating through the whole. From flashbacks of X-wing rising out of waters, from throwing away lightsabers (it happened at least thrice during this movie) to the Big Battle in the end. During this battle authors literally recycled the shots from Episode VI (Emperor seducing Luke while Rebel fleet is being exterminated). That is one interpretation.
There is another one as well. This movie is a bridge. The link between my generation, and that of my children. My generation can enjoy episodes IV to VI and keep argueing if Han shot first (yes, he did). But my children - they need new heroes, new adventures. The story though - a fairy tale in the Galaxy Far Far Away, the dreams - of exploration, of alien cultures and species, of friendship and loyalty - they are the same.

18273,Judy  H,"Feb 07, 2020","I loved it. I loved everything about it. It had all the ingredients  for a great finale. I have been a huge fan of the Star Wars saga ever since the premiere started back in the 70's. I've watched and followed each episode. I fell in love with Luke and Han and Leia and Anakin, C3PO, R2D2, Chewbaca, Yoda, Obie Ben Wan Kenobi, and all the rest. I love that in the face of great evil and hatred that our protaganists always chose to be good and hope and  love prevailed. When all looks lost, hard work and faith works wonders. I am so attached to all of the characters just as if they were family members and I will sorely miss them. Just like all of the endings in all the other episodes, The Rise of Skywalker leaves you with a warm feeling of Joy and Wellbeing.  Bravo! Well done! Well done! Thank you LUCAS FILMS. The Star Wars saga has been so important to me through the years as I was awed and thrilled and saddened and enlightened. I may never be a star figher pilot and galavant around the galaxy saving many worlds, but I lived it and loved the fantasy created through each film. I really loved the way the writer was able tie every thing together in a wonderful way. I loved this film and all the others. I stayed and watched the film and all of the credits as if to saver and appreciate all of the thousands of people it took to make this movie and to say a respectful good-bye to my old friends and their stories.

How the main character who did not have the power to win has all her power drained from her suddenly has the power to win with no explanation.  How the bad guy becomes a good guy without explanation for this transformation.  The story was poorly designed.
The unclear:   Significance of what was done at the end.  Is this it?   Is this an opening for another episode .  I dont think the writers had a clear plan when they wrote it & it could go either way.",3.5

While it tied all of the past story lines together, it did so in such a mishandled way that it seemed amateurish at best and incompetent at worst.",4.0
18374,redrooster,"Feb 11, 2020","Loved it. A great finale to a long-running saga. Is it perfect? Of course not, but it's a fun swashbuckling adventure which is what Star Wars is all about at its core. Also, my 6-year old was completely transfixed the whole time and has been playing lightsabers at home for days afterward. That's what Star Wars is all about.",5.0

18378,James J,"Feb 11, 2020","This was easily the best and most exciting movie in the new trilogy. However, too many mistakes and disappointments from the second installment (The Last Jedi) killed the momentum of the series. I am a life long Star Wars fan. I am glad that Dave Filoni is helming the Mandolorian with John Favreau, you can immediately see the difference. Back to this movie, the action and visuals are top notch. The story mostly sticks to gaining momentum toward the conclusion. There are a few missteps, but overall it is enjoyable and entertaining. Some folks will sit and stew with resentments for the direction and choices made and that will prevent their enjoyment. If you can look past all of that, it's worth watching. My advice is if you are angry, focus on another aspect of the universe. Just leave this one alone.",3.0

I was disappointed in the story, as with all the previous movies Rey's skill and prowess are totally unearned and we never see her developing, we are supposed to just take their word for it.  It makes for an unlikable character.  And it isn't even the BAD GUY, it's supposed to be the protagonist!   You end up liking Kylo more than any other character.

They crammed in way too much.  They didn't fill any plot wholes, but created new ones.  The death of the emperor was a complete joke.

18578,Diane,"Mar 04, 2020","Movie Review:

Episode 9 didnt suck me in as the others did. It looked beautiful, sounded beautiful, but it felt wrong. Its hard to feel something for characters that abruptly do a 360 until they become unrecognizable. I felt more for Rey in her first few minutes of intro in TFA then I did in the 3rd installment where I should have been more invested. Kylo Ren seemed to be the only interesting character that had a clear arc planned out and was kept consistent throughout the trilogy. Wished there was more of him and less of the others. Full of bold, interesting choices that were quickly negated and turned pointless and meaningless. The plot was over reliant on mcguffins and were pretty farfetched if you thought about it. Regardless of what you thought of TLJ, JJ should of continued that story rather than retcon it. 

The story choices JJ went for makes The Rise of Skywalker not thematically nor narratively cohesive to the whole Skywalker Saga. The Last Jedi was at least telling you something, it had a message. Rise didnt have much to say as much it had things to show a particular niche of the fans to evoke nostalgia instead of paving the way for a new generation of they want Star Wars to live on past the original trilogy fans. And if you are into the lore, this movie makes the canon contradicts each other.  

Overall, I never want to not like a Star Wars film, that is the worst as a Star Wars fan. If Star Wars can be described in one word, it would be hopeful. This one is anything but that, it left me feeling hopeless. 

The highlight of this trilogy was Adam Drivers nuance and complex performance as Kylo Ren. If this move has one salvageable moment, it was the scene between Adam Driver and Harrison Ford.",0.5

This movie felt rushed and stuffed full off scenes where no one plot point flowed into the next. Nevermind all the bits of the movie that were done for the sake of a twist or to be cinematic. I'm generally good at enjoying even a movie that's been panned (ignoring plots holes at times as well as ham-handed trope inclusion), but this had me checking my watch several times. We all know episodes vii-ix were created more to make money than to tell a story, but Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker made it obvious past the point of enjoyment.",2.0
18597,DELETED USER,"Mar 27, 2020","As far as a plot and script goes, it feels like I was watching something a film student put together on the last Sunday evening of the semester after spending the rest of the school year on a bender. ""I didn't have enough time to get it done."" Abrams essentially transformed all the efforts, accomplishments and sacrifices of the previous films' characters into an abyss of null and void. They died and sacrificed for nothing, ""watch my movie, those were a waste of your time,"" says JJ. If this was anything other than a Star Wars movie, I would have walked out on it about half way through, I really wish I never walked in on it. Special effects were great, it shows how the craft has matured over the years, that's it! Blown opportunities for character development, arc or making a logical movie. Too much fanboy ingratiation, while still leaving loose ends unfinished. What a shame. I've been a Star Wars fan since the 70s and have endured mostly sub-par movies, but I keep coming back because it's a great universe of possibilities, but for some reason no one has been able to get it right since the 80s. This latest trilogy started without originality; then it was blamed for becoming too original by all the fanboys; now it fights to get back to mediocrity and recycling old SW nostalgia but settles on the absurd. This is THE WORST Star Wars movie ever, and I didn't like any of the green screen prequels, but would gladly watch the Phantom Menace over this any day. I might even watch the Holiday Special before watching this again. I feel like I need to apologize to George Lucas for saying anything bad about the prequels because they look like masterpieces compared to what this latest trilogy became. The Force Wakes Up was forgiven for being unoriginal, but we were glad to have SW back. Last Jedi was going in a new direction and that was ok as long as they could pull it all together. There were still major problems with it, but I was willing to go along if they could fit it into the arc of SW, but no, JJ had to try to hit the reset button and work as a customer service rep trying to make the fanboys all happy by addressing every complaint right down to Chewbacca getting his ""long-deserved"" medal which is beyond stupid. Our moans during the movie turned into laughter at the embarrassment of this steaming pile by the end. Why can't we get a good writer/director for this franchise? It will be the first SW movie I won't have in my personal collection.",0.5

18599,Brady H,"Apr 10, 2020","Disappointing end to one of the greatest stories ever told. This one was better than the last one. just narrowly. The first installment of the new trilogy skated by on nostalgia and a general thirst for new Star Wars. Unfortunately Disneys acquisition proves this was all about money and pumping out as much Star Wars as quickly as possible with complete disregard for the property itself. This and the last felt hastily written and sloppy. It could just be that I grew up with Vader and the original characters, but I had a hard time believing or feeling like Kylo or Rey were so much stronger than their predecessors. The original trilogy had 3 year breaks between movies, both of these last two could have used at least an extra year, especially after the last one had to be rewritten. Snoke felt like a total throw away and why they didnt take that opportunity to insert a more compelling already existing character from the expanded universe or whatever its called now is a missed opportunity. It feels like Snoke was being built for something else and then plans changed quickly so they killed him. Why rush one of the most legendary and beloved stories ever? If it wasnt ready, delay and rewrite, people may be upset, but is that worth ruining Star Wars over? I suppose it is if youre only interested in money and could care less about ruining art. I could go on and on about everything that didnt work, but its easy enough to find those with a simple search. They may as well have ended this by having Jar Jar being the mastermind behind everything, studying the dark side and re-emerging as Darth Jar Jar killing everyone and flipping off the camera.",1.5

Overlong disjointed lesson in how not to make a movie, let alone end a series.  Instead of story and plot you got pointless kung fu scenes and journeys to no where and the dredging up of long dead characters that made no sense.  The Luke Skywalker saga was done at the end of Return of the Jedi - the ONLY reason for bring back the old cast members for this trilogy was to introduce the new cast - but JJ Abrams or Disney or both seem to have last sight of that in their effort to utilized outtakes of the dead Cary Fisher instead of writing a real ending and paying for real - live- actors.

18606,James A,"May 22, 2020","This is what happens when you do storytelling by committee and don't lay out clearly the overall story arc for the trilogy at the beginning and adhere to it. There are plenty of plot holes and headshaking moments to go around, from going to a planet to find a wayfinder and discovering a magical knife that will lead them to it completely by accident, to being in just the right spot on another planet when they discover the knife is also a locator for said wayfinder, to jumping in and out of hyperspace with reckless abandon (still remember Han Solo's advice to Luke: ""jumping through hyperspace ain't like dustin' crops, boy. It requires precise calculations...""), to the ridiculously stupid and unexplained rescue/resurrection of Palpatine after Return of the Jedi, to the forced kiss between Kylo and Rey, to Kylo's miraculous recovery after being thrown over a seemingly bottomless chasm, to yet another Death Star/Starkiller/planet exploder weapon, to yet another ridiculously simple flaw in said weapon, and so on.

I don't know how a group of adults (using that term loosely here) sat in a reading room for this and did not see the gaping holes in the plots and the complete disregard for suspension of disbelief, which is necessary for any movie to be compelling. I sat through this, painfully aware that I was sitting in a theater being forced crap that made no sense, and ultimately stared blankly at the screen to watch the moving pixels only because I made the commitment to finish this sad trilogy. If the characters turned and stared at the camera for laughs it would not have been any less disrupting to my suspension of disbelief than the poor storytelling and flashing and noise at the end.

On a positive note, this is at least mildly more entertaining than The Last Jedi, due to Abrams' better treatment of humor, and better story pacing. To be fair, a lot of stuff happens during this 2.5 hour film, but it's always better when things happen for a reason, and so much of this movie happens for no real reason, other than to sell toys or compensate for the damage done by TLJ. As visually stunning as it is, the movie is just a horrible example of storytelling, and ultimately I walked away from this trilogy in the Star Wars franchise painfully aware that it IS a franchise, and that none of the new characters are especially likeable, not even Rey, who rightfully earned the title of Mary Sue due to her inexplicable ability to master Jedi skills that took Luke Skywalker years and much effort to develop...all because of her blood line. Rey, Poe, and Finn are all very shallow, forgettable characters who emote, but don't convey real struggle or desire and achieve greatness almost by entitlement. Poe magically maneuvers spaceships impossibly fast around targets and never misses, Rey goes from picking up Luke's light saber to being a saber fighting master over what? A few months? She never changes her outfit once throughout the whole trilogy! And Finn? He occasionally shoots and blows up a TIE fighter and shouts ""whoa!"" when he does, and through luck manages to avoid his own death at least a few times. As I said, completely shallow and forgettable characters.

18633,Gregory,"Nov 07, 2021","Given how #8 ruined the trilogy, this movie tied it up amazingly well. Hope they redo 7-9 some day, though, to fix the dozens of plot mistakes.",5.0
18634,Aaron,"Nov 18, 2021",was really good. wish things would have ended differently.,4.0
18635,Gary,"Nov 23, 2021",I'm a Star Wars nerd at heart so I really loved this movie and IMAX was amazing!!!!,5.0
18636,Jeff C,"Dec 28, 2021",There are some things Disney should not be part of. This is one example. They are not one with the force.,2.5
18637,Steven,"Jan 28, 2022",Really disappointing conclusion to the sequel trilogy. Bringing back Palpatine was a big mistake.,2.5
18638,Allie F,"Feb 04, 2022","I was relieved this movie had less of the adolescent temper tantrums seen in the previous one. The VFX was fun as usual, and visually appealing. Though, I did wish there was a bit more depth. I kept wishing for a bit more character development... and as a Star Wars fan, of course, even more epic use of the Force! I still love the 3 classics the most, and I guess those movies really set a high bar that most of these newer SW films have not quite matched.",3.5
